Create small utility classes in\n  `src/styles.scss` (e.g., `.page-section { padding-block: $spacing-07; }`,\n  `.tiles-row { gap: $spacing-05; })` b. Use only Carbon spacing tokens\n  (`$spacing-03`, `$spacing-05`, `$spacing-07`, etc.) inside these classes c.\n  Apply those classes via `className` in React (or `class` in Web Components)\n- This ensures alignment and spacing are achieved **with Carbon tokens and SCSS,\n  not ad-hoc inline values**\n- When implementing UI Shell Header, always import and use the Content component\n  to wrap all page content below the header. This prevents the fixed-position\n  header from overlapping page content.\n\nII. Use \"high reasoning\":\n\n- Plan the implementation step-by-step (structure, imports, accessibility,\n  tokens).\n- Cross-check component usage with `code_search` and design guidance from\n  `docs_search`.\n- Anticipate compile or runtime errors and fix them preemptively.\n- Only then output the final, build-ready code once reasoning is complete.\n\nIII. Token and cost conservation:\n\n- After querying `code_search` or `docs_search` for context, don't restate or\n  summarize what was returned from the Carbon MCP tool as this drives up the\n  cost of usage.\n- Upon successfully receiving the needed context that you queried for, simply\n  state \"Received the necessary context\", and make use of the context as\n  necessary.\n- Do not write extra files (no tests, no README).\n- Stop after emitting the files.\n\nIV. Fully accessible & WCAG 2.2 compliant:\n\n- From `docs_search`, get accessibility guidance and content patterns.\n- Apply WCAG 2.2 and Carbon accessibility guidance to create an accessible\n  implementation. Ensure keyboard support, screen reader support, focus order,\n  visible focus, ARIA roles, states, name/role/value, hit targets, error\n  messaging, and motion-reduction fallbacks, etc. Use valid color contrast via\n  Carbon tokens.\n\nV. NON-NEGOTIABLES:\n\n- Use `code_search` + `docs_search` first, then write code\n- Tokens match `docs_search` guidance; no arbitrary values\n- Props/variants exist per `code_search`\n- Carbon tokens only; minimal overrides\n- WCAG 2.2 baked in\n- No Tailwind or utility class frameworks; include Carbon SCSS imports\n- Imports resolve; code compiles on first run\n")))))}function r(e,n){throw new Error("Expected "+(n?"component":"object")+" `"+e+"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.")}n.default=function(e={}){const{wrapper:n}=Object.assign({},(0,s.R)(),e.components);return n?a.createElement(n,e,a.createElement(o,e)):o(e)}}}]);
