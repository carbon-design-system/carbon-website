## Overview

This section answers the question: "What problem does this pattern solve?"

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user's needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Pattern image

`IMAGE w/ annotations`

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

Use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.

## The solution

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

### Behaviors, structure, and functionality

- Describe pattern behaviors, including descriptions as well as any guidance on interactions and states.
- List out specific use cases, as well as situations where you would not use this pattern.
- Show the pattern in context. Include any user flows, and/or prototypes as needed.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Pattern visuals

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling. See our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) for information about creating assets for
the IBM Design System.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the pattern's behavior.
- Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this pattern.

### Variations

If there are variations that support different use cases, include those here
with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for
using one pattern over another.

## Related patterns and components

Provide links to related patterns and components.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets [accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,
and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to being typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

## References

Include any citations for research, books, and articles you found helpful. These
help designers understand your decisions.

## Feedback

We'll include a feedback section here to gather questions and comments.
