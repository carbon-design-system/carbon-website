# Pattern template

## How to use this file

This Markdown template includes guidelines to help you prepare a complete and comprehensive pattern for submission to the IBM Design System.

Copy and paste the content below into a Markdown editor, or Box note if you'd prefer, then replace the headings and explanations of the template with your content. Depending on the pattern, you may need to make some adjustments to the structure but your pattern should cover all of the aspects outlined here.

## Overview

This section answers the question: "What problem does this pattern solve?"

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user's needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Anatomy

`Show pattern in visual form`

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

Use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

## The solution

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written explanations and visuals to tell the story.

Break this section out as needed for your pattern. Refer to the other Carbon patterns for inspiration.

### Behaviors, structure, and functionality

- Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.
- Describe pattern behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.
- Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are telling. See our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) for information about creating assets for the IBM Design System.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the pattern's behavior.

Provide a [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/docs/getting-started/) with any symbols you've created in the development of this pattern.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Other use cases

If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for using one solution over another.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets [accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines, and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”
