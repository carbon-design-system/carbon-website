### Overview

**Define your pattern with a name and a problem statement.** This is where you should explain a user's needs, and how the pattern meets those needs. It's also where you should communicate what a designer needs to know about the pattern.

**Detail the pattern's status and its goals, and show a high-level image of the pattern in use.** If the pattern is design-ready but needs code implementation, ask for help. Define what the final state of the pattern can and will be.

### Behavior guidance

**Explain what to do and what not to do.** Some guidance may need context, and this context can be provided with contextual images and scenarios.

**Include guidance on interactions and states.** Most patterns depend on interactions with components, which includes the motion, behavior, and states of those components. Define these, including any context necessary.

**Use visuals wherever possible.** User experience diagrams are invaluable for product designers. Show a user's flow through your pattern, and include images of an actual product at each step of the way.

### Assets

**Include any resources and references.** Attach and document any page templates, design guidelines, and design software assets.

**Document how a user would navigate your pattern.** Many sites and apps include usage documentation. Provide whatever documentation you might have to make onboarding and use easier.

### References

**Create a functional prototype.** The best way to prove your pattern solves a problem is to let designers test it. A link to the actual implementation is best, and a demo is also valuable.

**Explain any accessibility testing you conducted.** No individual component or pattern can be accessible, but they can be used in an accessible way to create an accessible experience. Include any research and proof you may have in your pattern documentation.

**Include any citations.** Research, books, and articles you found helpful offer legitimacy to your pattern and help designers understand your decisions.

**Create a design specification.** This includes the exact dimensions, layout, and tokens you used to implement the pattern.

**Offer any development notes you may have.** Many patterns don't require specific developer attention to implement. If there's any information specific to code implementation, include it here.

### MetadataÂ 

**Surface a changelog.** Seeing regular updates lets a designer know the pattern is still maintained. It also offers insight into any decisions that may have been made.

**Include a list of related components.** Patterns use several components and function alongside several others. List those here, along with links to where they're hosted.

**Link to related patterns.** This may not be the right pattern for a designer's problem. Link to related patterns to provide full usage context.

**Include a link to the component's maintainer.** It's likely there will be times when a pattern's maintainer must be contacted.

**Communicate what happens next.** If there are any outstanding issues or gaps, include those here. Ask for help if you need it, and be transparent about the completeness of the pattern.
