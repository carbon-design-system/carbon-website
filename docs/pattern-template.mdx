## Overview

This section answers the question: "What problem does this pattern solve?"

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user's needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Pattern image

`Show pattern in visual form`

## The solution

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written explanations and visuals to tell the story.

### Behaviors, structure, and functionality

- Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.
- Describe pattern behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.
- Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are telling. See our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) for information about creating assets for the IBM Design System.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the pattern's behavior.

Provide a [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/docs/getting-started/) with any symbols you've created in the development of this pattern.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with making choices.
