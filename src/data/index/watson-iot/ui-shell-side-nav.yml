  The UI shell side nav panel provides users with their primary method of
  navigating around the different areas of our applications from the left hand
  side of the users screen. In the Watson IoT design system, we use the Carbon
  left panel as a base but deviate in both behaviour and styling in some small,
  but significant ways.
