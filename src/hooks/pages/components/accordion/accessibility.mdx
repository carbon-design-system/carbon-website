## How it works

The accordion Carbon component provides a vertically stacked layout for web
content, commonly used to reduce scrolling. The accordion header is a button
that is used to expand and collapse each accordion panel. Buttons are used so
that the accordions are tab-able by keyboard users and accessible to screen
readers. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` are used to navigate through each accordion
header and all focusable elements in the accordion should be included in the
page `Tab` sequence. `Enter` or `Space` expand and collapse each accordion
panel.

When an accordion panel is collapsed the content is hidden, therefore the ARIA
state `aria-expanded="false"` advises users of assistive technologies that the
accordion panel is not visible. When the accordion header is expanded the ARIA
state changes to `aria-expanded="true"` and the accordion panel content is
displayed. Each accordion header contains an ARIA label, and the header buttons
have an ARIA-control property set that points to the unique id of the panel it
controls. When focus is on the accordion header there is a prominent style
change to the border as well as background of the accordion header.

## Accessibility considerations

This component has been validated to meet the
[WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and
[Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) accessibility guidelines, however
changes made by the content owner can affect accessibility compliance. Be sure
to review and follow the guidance in this section when updating or adding new
content to this component.

1. Each accordion header must have a unique title (implemented via the label for
   the button) that clearly describes the accordion panel content. This is
   particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the
   necessary information to efficiently navigate the content without having to
   expand every section.
1. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within
   each accordion panel.
1. Avoid keyboard traps when adding components to the accordion panel. For
   example, the user expands an accordion, but is unable to tab to the next
   focusable element.
1. Although the accordion component passes accessibility testing, content
   authors need to ensure the content that is added to the accordion is
   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the accordion header or panel
   you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.
