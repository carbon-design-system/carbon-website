The dropdown React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
and violations have been identified as high priority issues. This document will
be updated when these accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. Avoid very long option names to facilitate understandability and
   perceivability.
2. Do not use the same word or phrase at the beginning of a set of options.
3. Avoid options that contain headings and interactive elements such as links,
   buttons, or checkboxes.
4. If the dropdown is a required field include the
   [aria-required property](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA2.html) and
   indicate that it is a required field and use the validation message for input
   errors.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been
performed on the dropdown React Carbon Component.
[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues
have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available
in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
