## Executive summary

placeholder

## The challenge

(CIO goals, research, marketshare info)

## Proposed solution

(incremental improvements = increases to revenue)

## The approach

- Took on Carbon as an iterative process. Rolled it out slowly. Tactfully and
  tastefully. Shixie working closely with the development squad.
- Do it iteratively, see what is moving the needle, taking those experiences and
  expanding across the platform as we learn more.

### Start small

\*\* We could do a motion of the image Shixie shows. New modal sitting on an
older page.

- Started small with a modal that pops up to get the team used to using Carbon
  - "Instead of reskinning existing elements, we identified high value,
    self-contained, new features to develop in Carbon from scratch."
  - Team not worried about breaking something in production, safe place to
    experiment and ship, and see results, this way they wouldn't be losing as
    much money if the feature broke something
  - Took about a month because the team was new to Carbon
  - Not very disruptive to have the new modal on the old page
  - It's okay to ship out pieces iteratively. Encourage people to mix
    experiences to eventually get to the final result faster, otherwise flipping
    the switch on everything at once takes too long and can be risky.

### Design system education

- Another part of the process was spending an hour or two with the dev team to
  learn about the design system. A crash course. It was really fast.
- Objective was to get the designers and devs on the same page in terms of
  language so that the implementation goes faster.
- Quiz and tooling training (it looks like with Abstract as one of the tools)

### Mix new with old

### Plan for iterations

- iterative process, done in passes
  - switching fields into Carbon fields, but maintaining the structure
  - then the buttons change
  - at some point, people may not even notice that the complete experience has
    changed, setting the stage for next gen proposal
- didn't have a screenshot of the page in its old layout before it was moved to
  3 sections

## Benefits

### Sped up delivery

Speed up delivery, only 3 months to migrate to Carbon, the dev cycle was mcuh
faster when we started using straight-up Carbon

### Minimal QA

Minimal design QA because many components were straight out of the box

### Continuity in experience

Improved continuity in user experience from previous IBM touch points â€” Support,
My IBM. A lot of these experiences will now feel continuous and intuitive.

Looks great!

## Positive outcomes

- Since launch in march, 53% of customers are converting to purchase post-carbon
  (was 48%)
- U.S. conversation are relatively flat but the other top 5 countries
  (Australia, UK, Ireland, Canada, South Korea) are all converting at +3% or +4%
  higher
- 0.1% increase is the entire process from pricing to order complete, 5% is from
  checkout to order purchase (only a few screens)

## Next steps

- Next, currently working on the configuration page.
- When we have the complete end-to-end flow live, we'll continue to increase our
  conversions.
