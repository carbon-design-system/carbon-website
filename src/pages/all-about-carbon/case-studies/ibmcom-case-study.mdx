## Summary

This section provides a succinct and effective summary that is quick to read,
and covers the key highlights and takeaways.

## The challenge

### Project goals

Deliver a touchless experience. Make it super easy and intuitive for a user to
find the product they need and quickly and effectively make a purchase.

- 25% NPS improvement
- Decrease clicks
- Decrease page load time
- Increase device compatibility
- Drive down time spent on a page

Two bullets directly addressed by Carbon refresh — which ones?

The overarching goals of the CIO squad tied directly with what the design group
proposed.

### Testing and research

From testing, knew there were inherent usability issues in the checkout process.
Problems we knew about on the page: — too many choices

- too much information on the page
- not intuitive
- no clear message
- the flow was difficult to control
- cumbersome
- editing was difficult

Looking at the metrics — if we could improve the overall user experience from
the start of configuring the quote all the way through to the purchase, every
0.1% improvement in purchase conversion is worth \$1M.

Many small improvements together could have a big impact to company revenue.

### Marketshare info

If we did nothing, what would happen?

— our competition was outperforming us in terms of conversion — behind on the
eCommerce marketplace, on the market share — customer quotes and research —> our
customers said they found it unreliable, not able to quickly and efficiently
find what they wanted, so they were abandoning our flow.

## Proposed solution

(incremental improvements = increases to revenue)

Looking at the end-to-end flow. A waterflow that shows all the tactics that
could be undertaken in order to increase conversion, at each step of the
customer journey. See where customers are dropping off across the flow.

- insert image "example of metrics"

Carbon implementation addresses a core percentage of the pages that we're trying
to support.

If we could improve these pages especially for returning users, can easily find
earlier work, then this a win-win for everyone.

Knew what they would get from the Carbon refresh:

- be better for the user

- wouldn't get lost in the flow,

- could find what they need,

- less likely to defect

Will it grow revenue? Funnel analysis beforehand made it clear that even small
improvements would improve revenue dramatically. (Outcomes slide)

Carbon refresh directly maps to the CIO business goal of the touchless user
experience

Refresh configuration and improve ease of use for returning customers, increase
conversion

Very high drop-off percentages from when a customer started their configuration.

Only 8% completion.

Lot of room to make a big improvement. Increase conversions by a few
percentages.

**Results**

Before Carbon 38% of customers were converting to purchase (not sure from
where). Not even half were starting and finishing.

71% of US customers were converting, but other top 5 five countries were much
lower

By Carbon refresh globally, could increase global metrics as well. Important to
everyone.

- compelling metrics slide a little hard to read

## Our approach

Took on Carbon as an iterative process. Rolled it out slowly. Tactfully and
tastefully. Shixie working closely with the development squad.

Do it iteratively, see what is moving the needle, taking those experiences and
expanding across the platform as we learn more.

Mapped out an adoption process — the logic of what we wanted to do first and how
we tried to approach the whole problem.

### Start small

Started small with a modal that pops up to get the team used to using Carbon

- Instead of reskinning existing elements, we identified high value,
  self-contained, new features to develop in Carbon from scratch.

- Team not worried about breaking something in production, safe place to
  experiment and ship, and see results, this way they wouldn't be losing as much
  money if the feature broke something

- Took about a month because the team was new to Carbon

- Not very disruptive to have the new modal on the old page

- It's okay to ship out pieces iteratively. Encourage people to mix experiences
  to eventually get to the final result faster, otherwise flipping the switch on
  everything at once takes too long and can be risky.

### Design system education

- Another part of the process was spending an hour or two with the dev team to
  learn about the design system. A crash course. It was really fast.

- Objective was to get the designers and devs on the same page in terms of
  language so that the implementation goes faster.

- Quiz and tooling training (it looks like with Abstract as one of the tools)

### Mix new with old

Started with a fresh feature. A safe place to experiment with Carbon and ship
right away. It took about a month because the team was new to Carbon.

Mixed the new modal is sitting on the old page. It's not too disruptive.

Note - We could do a motion of the image Shixie shows. New modal sitting on an
older page.

It's okay to ship out pieces iteratively. Encourage people to mix experiences to
eventually get to the final result faster, otherwise flipping the switch on
everything at once takes too long and can be risky.

Another feature that was good to isolate and sandbox from the flow. Confirmation
page after the user has checked out successfully — redesigned the experience to
be simplified. Removing redundant information from the screen that would be in
an email etc.

It was an isolated place to get the team on board with Carbon. It was a way to
get people used to using Carbon. And in the following example, getting
comfortable with the grid in particular.

### Plan for iterations

Iterative process to implement. Changing the layout of the pages. Done in small
passes:

- switching fields into Carbon fields, but maintaining the structure

- then the buttons change

- at some point, people may not even notice that the complete experience has
  changed, setting the stage for next gen proposal

- Checkout page example

- Order confirmation page example The entire Carbonation process took only three
  months. And it's a complicated application

## Benefits

### Sped up delivery

Speed up delivery, only 3 months to migrate to Carbon, the dev cycle was mcuh
faster when we started using straight-up Carbon

### Minimal QA

Minimal design QA because many components were straight out of the box.
Developers liked very much that Carbon components could be used straight of out
of the box.

### Continuity in experience

Improved continuity in user experience from previous IBM touch points — Support,
My IBM. A lot of these experiences will now feel continuous and intuitive.

You can see with these pages, that now there is a real continuity of experience
for the users.

They are all organized in the exact same way. There's familiarity and a feeling
of dependability.

Looks great!

## Positive outcomes

- Since launch in March, 53% of customers are converting to purchase post-carbon
  (was 48%)
- U.S. conversions are relatively flat but the other top 5 countries (Australia,
  UK, Ireland, Canada, South Korea) are all converting at +3% or +4% higher
- 0.1% increase is the entire process from pricing to order complete, 5% is from
  checkout to order purchase (only a few screens)

### User feedback quotes

Maybe work out a way to include user quotes in here.

## Next steps

- Next, currently working on the configuration page.
- When we have the complete end-to-end flow live, we'll continue to increase our
  conversions.
