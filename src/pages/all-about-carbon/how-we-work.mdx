The Carbon team encourages adoption through guidance and training, community
development, maintenance, and support. The system is primarily maintained by a
core team and governed by a board of design advisors.

## Adoption

**We conduct training classes and offer certifications.** These cover
introductions to Carbon and participating in this community. Each program is
piloted internally and available upon release externally. We teach at
conferences, bootcamp labs, and wherever else we're needed.

**We engage the community.** We strive to be one of the world’s best design
systems and we’re always
[open to feedback](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=).
We communicate with you about Carbon's state and roadmap through GitHub support,
blog posts, and Twitter.

**Contributed components and patterns include a list of maintainers.** The
Carbon team triages and supports maintenance requests that do not have a
maintainer. Unmaintained patterns will be demoted to Experimental if the Carbon
team decides not to maintain them.

**We provide support for users of the design system.** The Carbon team engages
with users primarily through GitHub. A member of the Carbon team responds to all
issues and pull requests.

## Assets

**We maintain a set of Sketch libraries containing Carbon components and
patterns.** There is a funnel of contribution for rigorous Sketch symbols before
they are made available in Sketch libraries.

**Carbon supports multiple code implementations.** These reflect the
production-level design libraries. The frameworks are listed below with their
primary maintainers:

- [React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core team
- [CSS/Vanilla](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core
  team
- [Angular](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/): Community maintained
- [Vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue):
  Community maintained

**Design patterns are harvested from products built with Carbon.** These become
part of the design system. Teams can use these well-defined patterns in their
work and contribute patterns back to the system.
