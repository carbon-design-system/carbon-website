Carbon is not just one team. To sustain productive contribution and maintain a
clear direction for Carbon as a whole, various groups work together to provide
direction, governance, and support.

## Steering committee

The Carbon Design System steering committee provides oversight and direction for
Carbon and its design and development community, to improve the Carbon Design
System for IBM and the world. It is made up of Carbon practitioners to ensure
Carbon stays true to the community we’re serving.

<Row className={dividedSection}>
<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>

#### Drive impactful human and business outcomes

</Column>
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

The steering committee represents the voice of the customer and business,
reflecting the diverse objectives of the IBM Design and development community.
We ensure Carbon Design System delivers business value, which in turn drives
outcomes that people love.

</Column>
</Row>

<Row className={dividedSection}>
<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>

#### Scale design consistency and excellence

</Column>
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

The steering committee provides line of sight into our respective patterns and
best practices. By doing so, we support the community effort to improve the
consistency of the human experience. To scale excellence, we share successes,
either from using Carbon, or as input to improving Carbon. As a committee, we
amplify key projects of high potential business value to influence Carbon's
priorities.

</Column>
</Row>

<Row className={dividedSection}>
<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>

#### Grow and strengthen the community

</Column>
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

The steering committee engages our respective networks of collaborators and
resources to consume, contribute to, and innovate Carbon. We feed a virtuous
cycle in which Carbon advocacy grows by freeing Designers and Developers to
focus on higher level solutions, which they contribute back into Carbon.  This
increases the internal and external eminence of Carbon Design System and IBM.
