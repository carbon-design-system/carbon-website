## Releases

Each Carbon Design System release includes package releases that are
independently versioned following the industry-standard
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org) specification.

The Carbon team also ships package minor releases every other week and when
necessary, patch releases between minor versions to address bugs. Read more in
Carbon's
[release radar](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/wiki/Release-radar).

### Carbon v11

Carbon v11 focuses on quality of life updates for designers and developers
including token and prop renaming for ease of use, component API updates for a
more predictable developer experience, and introducing CSS grid for accurate
layout building in line with the design language.

With no changes to the IBM Design Language, v11 will not require any
brand-driven product redesigns and teams are free to update at their
convenience. For more details about this release, see our
[v11 release page](/whats-happening/v11-release/).

### Carbon v10

Carbon v10 implemented our newly-updated brand expression (IBM Design Language
v2) into our components. The updated components required product teams to
redesign product UIs and begin a migration plan to comply with IBM brand
experience standards. For more details about this release, see our
[v10 release page](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/migration-guide/overview).
