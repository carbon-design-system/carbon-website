## Overview

At its core, Carbon has universal assets–elements, components, patterns, and
code–and guidance for how to design and build with them. These assets are
considered universal or fundamental in nature, which means they can be used as a
base for the widest variety of situations, and extended or adapted for the
specific business use cases.

Beyond this core is a distributed ecosystem of sites that support and serve the
design and development communities within IBM and, where open source content is
available, the external community as well.

The following sites within the Carbon community include guidance, assets, and
resources for all of IBM’s digital experiences from product to website. _Note
that some guidance is accessible to IBMers only._

## Community assets

### Component index

These components are developed and maintained by members of the IBM Carbon
community. They may change over time, and they may be incomplete or
experimental. For support, please contact the maintainers listed on each page.

## Brand

The journey to understand IBM brand guidance begins with the foundations in the
Brand Center, then extends to the expression of brand as documented in the IBM
Design Language (IDL) site. From there, go to the IBM Brand Systems for visual
systems and guidance tailored to our hero brands, category brands, and
offerings.
