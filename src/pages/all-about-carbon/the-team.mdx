## Overview

Carbon is funded and built by IBM. That means we build for the company’s
business needs. Carbon is also an open source community-driven project. It is
available for anyone to use and everyone is encouraged to contribute.

To sustain productive contribution and maintain a clear direction for Carbon as
a whole, there are various groups within IBM that provide governance and
support.

## The Carbon team

Carbon is maintained by a dedicated team of designers, developers, and writers
based in the Austin, Texas IBM Design Studio.

## Board of directors

The Carbon Design System Board of Directors is comprised of executive
stakeholders. They oversee the direction of Carbon.

### Responsibilities

The key responsibilities of the Board are as follows:

- Hold the steering committee, and Carbon as a whole, accountable for delivery
  of design excellence, standards, guidance and business impact.
- Provide the steering committee feedback on business needs, to facilitate a
  Carbon roadmap that meets those needs.
- Champion Carbon adoption and Carbon standards within their organization.
- Where possible, commit to engaging design or development resources from within
  their organization to help accomplish the Carbon roadmap.

The Board is supported by the Steering Committee, whose role is to provide
oversight and direction for Carbon and its community, and related projects.

Members of the Board meet for one half day every quarter, at which they review a
quarterly report from the Steering Committee. This report details the status of
design quality, adoption, and contribution from the product teams/business units
from the Carbon Design System.

  universal.
- Facilitate consolidation of components and patterns where multiples exist -
  i.e. “pick winners”.
- Assess and vote to approve or deny community proposals (e.g. if a particular

  given _committer_ rights to all or part of the Carbon codebase).

  recommend members who can contribute.

committee for approval.

### Current working groups
