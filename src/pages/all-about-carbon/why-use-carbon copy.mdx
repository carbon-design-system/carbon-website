Carbon is for every member of a cross-functional product team—designers,
developers, marketers and offering managers. The complexity of what we build
means we work across multiple teams, disciplines, and functions to deliver a
full experience to our users.

Every point along a user's journey needs to feel part of a holistic, branded
experience—that's where Carbon comes in.

## Designers

Designers are passionate advocates for users, and Carbon helps them provide
value to our users with accessible, fully-tested assets and guidance that
designers can rely on to create cohesive experiences that are in line with other
business units.

- Carbon helps designers build excellent experiences for our users that are
  consistent, delightful, and thoughtful.
- Carbon allows designers to quickly create tailored solutions for our clients,
  drawing on Carbon's reusable kit of parts. This saves valuable time that can
  be spent on innovating new solutions.
- Carbon enables product and .com designers across the organization to explore
  and deliver the full potential of a design, leveraging the work of other teams
  where possible, avoiding redesign and duplication of efforts, keeping the
  focus on the distinct client use cases.

### Designer checklist for Carbon

## Developers

Carbon provides developers with the tools they need to build more product in
less time, while saving them from the mind-numbing work of creating the same
base components over and over again.

- By leveraging Carbon's pre-built assets, developers free themselves (and their
  backlogs) up to do the innovative work that inspires them and ultimately
  elevates the user experience for our clients.
- Developers can create products that are cohesive with other business
  units—high-quality, consistent, and robust front-end experiences that share
  the IBM brand.

## Marketers

Carbon allows teams to build excellent experiences that differentiate IBM from
the competition.

Products and experiences built with Carbon provide an interoperability of
experience and visuals across products. More complex multiproduct stories are
easier to tell when product experiences are in lock step.

### Marketers checklist for Carbon

- Visit [IBM Brand Center](https://www.ibm.com/brand) to learn more about
  foundational brand compliance, as well as for the hero brand systems that
  drive IBM's portfolio of products and experiences.

- The majority of marketing experiences use Carbon web components. Visit
  [Carbon for ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/)
  to ensure that these experiences are adhering to Carbon guidance.

- Familiarize yourself with
  [ibm.com web standards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/) to assess the
  legal compliance of your experience.

- Make sure all digital experiences by third parties meet IBM-A accessibility
  requirements:

  - [Marketing materials](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/launch/readiness#marketing-materials)
  - [Supplier and Partnership Accessibility Requirements and Process](http://ibm.biz/SupplierAccessibility)
  - [Accessibility guidelines for suppliers](http://blob:https//www.ibm.com/c4c955b3-b746-c74c-86de-c852f7f1462a)

  ## Product managers

Carbon improves business outcomes (increased lifetime value, revenue, NPS &
decreased churn) and wins awards in both the
[product](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/awards) and the
[digital](https://medium.com/design-ibm/ibm-cloud-app-id-and-assist-me-win-indigo-design-awards-47600197f780)
realms.

Carbon accelerates team productivity and time-to-market.

### Product manager checklist for Carbon

- Stay current with Carbon's
  [releases and roadmap](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/whats-happening/releases/)
  to prioritize upgrading Carbon (new assets, upstream fixes, designer/developer
  workflow improvements, tooling enhancements, etc.) vs. allowing time towards
  product features and fixes.

- Provide the Carbon team with adoption and migration feedback, as well as
  measured product performance with regard to Carbon, providing a healthy
  collaboration loop. You can find
  [migration worksheets and other resources here](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/dux/).

## Sales

Multiproduct stories are easier to tell and sell when product experiences work
together seamlessly. Suites of products built on the same foundation, that have
the same interactions are a dream to demo.

Carbon also extends
[IBM iX's capabilities,](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/11/04/adobe-and-ibm-ix-extend-partnership-to-help-enterprises-design-powerful-and-consistent-customer-experiences.html#gs.101gaxd)
allowing iX customers to implement and customize Carbon, showcasing it's
adaptability as a white-label design system.

### Sales checklist for Carbon

- Consultants who are selling digital solutions to clients should understand the
  benefits of Carbon for rapid prototyping, demo'ing and building.

- Our IBM consultants are the champions of third party Carbon use. Carbon looks
  to them for the following:
  - Creating case studies that highlight the effective use and benefits of
    Carbon.
  - Providing information about gaps in third party capabilities, as well as
    prioritized client requests.

## Support

Product experiences that are built on the same foundation and work together
seamlessly to reduce cognitive load for users, thereby reducing user errors and
questions, and significantly reducing the need for support.

Consistent experiences also result in less need for extensive training and
onboarding resources; learning can be leveraged across multiple spaces.

### Support checklist for Carbon

- Make a
  [Github issue](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/contributing/bugs-and-requests/)
  to report bugs or address gaps.

- Report issues in these primary support Slack channels:
  - [#carbon-design-system](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0M053VPT/)
  - [#carbon-components](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C046Y0YUD)
  - [#carbon-react](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2K6RFJ1G)
