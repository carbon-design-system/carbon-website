## Overview

With support from senior leadership, the IBM Cloud PAL team facilitated the
transition from Carbon 9 to Carbon 10 for all IBM Cloud services. While this
effort was led by the Cloud PAL team, they involved the Cloud community,
starting with a Design Jam and a visual design guild.

The transition was split into four phases that most Cloud services completed at
the same time. Because the majority of services switched to Carbon together,
there was a smooth, unified user experience with the updates.

Using patterns created with Carbon 10, IBM Cloud was able to reduce their user
journeys by seven steps and raise their NPS score by 57%. IBM Cloud has also
seen increases in operational efficiency for developer and designers now using
Carbon 10. They have also found in user research that participants prefer the
new designs and the average time to provision a service has improved by 4%.

## The challenge

Carbon 10 was released in Q2 2019. The update included major visual and
structural changes to align with the revamped IBM Design Language. Part of these
updates involved a redesign of existing components and introduced the UI shell
and the 2x Grid. With hundreds of services, IBM Cloud needed a way to manage the
transition from Carbon 9 and Carbon 10 at an organizational level.

## The proposed solution

### Creating a pattern and asset library

In order to coordinate the transition to Carbon 10, IBM Cloud leveraged their
Platform Integration Experiences team to create a Pattern and Asset Library
(PAL) that was specific to Cloud services. Because they were transitioning so
many services, IBM Cloud was able to create a dedicated, cross-functional team
that was solely focused on supporting the transition to Carbon 10 and the
creation of Cloud-specific assets and resources.

Rather than the project being grassroots and trying to convince every single
team to participate, the transition started from the top. The IBM Cloud VP of
Design, Arin Bhowmick, and Director of Design, Bill Grady, made the case for the
effort and mandated that Cloud teams participate.

Creating a PAL and getting the hundreds of Cloud services to adopt both Carbon
10 and Cloud PAL needed a specific dedicated team with a project plan. While the
Cloud PAL team managed the logistics of the transition, they wanted to build a
community around the effort so they brought the whole organization into the
effort, starting with a Design Jam.

## The approach

### Kicking off with a Design Jam

In May 2019 when the effort was just beginning, the Cloud PAL team held a Design
Jam. Designers and developers across all the Cloud services came together for a
day and worked to create preliminary patterns using the Carbon 10 guidelines.
They were split into random groups and given a design pattern to create during
the workshop. Because the members of each group all had different roles and came
from different teams, they were able to share and build on different
perspectives and this led to the teams coming up with pretty solid first draft
patterns.

### Establishing a visual design guild

The patterns that came out of the Design Jam were a great starting place, but
they were simple and safe. They lacked the brand identity and excitement that
the Cloud PAL team knew was necessary for the effort to be successful.

A Cloud visual design guild came together to create explorations for the Design
Jam patterns to push them further. Each week the guild met with the Carbon team
to receive feedback and ensure the explorations were aligned with Carbon 10 and
the IBM Design Language. When the templates and patterns were locked down, they
were the best they could be and had been vetted by the Carbon team, the Brand
team, and the Cloud community.

### Publishing coded templates and patterns

Cloud PAL used the Carbon 10 guidance and components to create templates and
patterns for Cloud-specific use cases and flows. Cloud PAL published templates
and resources, primarily based on the design guild deliverables, that were more
specific and prescriptive for Cloud than the Carbon guidance. They not only
designed these templates and patterns, but also coded them, so that teams would
be implementing the exact same pieces.

The Cloud patterns included bespoke APIs which meant when teams used a pattern
or template, they were given all the code with the APIs and parameters baked in
so that everything worked the same and multiple teams didn't spend time
implementing the same APIs over and over.

Over the course of the transition, Cloud PAL designed a total of 22 patterns
that cover 90% of Cloud UIs.

### Adoption management

#### The phases

Initially, the Cloud PAL team discussed supporting adoption in groups, so that
not every team had to transition over to using Carbon 10 at the same time.
Ultimately, they decided against this because they did not want to have to
provide dual maintenance while teams switched over. Instead, they decided to use
a phased approach with four phases that every team had to follow.

1. First, teams migrated to Carbon 10 components and patterns but used a Carbon
   9 theme so the visual style still matched what they currently had. They also
   began introducing some Cloud PAL components during this phase.
2. During the second phase, the Carbon 10 theme was toggled on and all Cloud
   teams switched from using the Carbon 9 theme to using the Carbon 10 theme.
   This meant that teams were prepared for the transition and all the Cloud
   services switched to using the Carbon 10 visual style at the same time.
3. By phase three, all the services were already using Carbon 10, so this phase
   focused on the Cloud PAL patterns. During this time, teams were expected to
   adopt the core Cloud PAL patterns to further unify the services.
4. Finally, they could focus on continuous delivery. Teams continuously adopted
   new patterns and components as they were released by the Cloud PAL team.

#### Governance

With the support of their design executives, a governance model was established.
During each phase, service teams had to go through a review with the Cloud PAL
team. These reviews followed well-documented rubrics and ensured that teams were
meeting the requirements for each phase.

Requirements on the rubric were each given a priority level of Priority 1,
Priority 2, or Priority 3. If a team failed a Priority 1 requirement, they could
not release the update until the requirement had been addressed. The reviews
gave the Cloud PAL team insight into how teams were applying the Carbon and
Cloud PAL guidance and gave them an opportunity to address any miscommunications
or inconsistencies before the services were released.

While most of the Cloud services were required to participate in this effort, it
did not make sense for every single service to participate. The governance model
included an exemption process for teams that did not think their services should
adopt Carbon 10 and the Cloud PAL.

This process, however, was just as involved as adoption itself, so it was not an
easier route for teams to take. Teams who wanted an exemption needed to get sign
off from their executives and needed to provide a real justification that
outlined the client impact. They found that many of the teams applying for an
exemption really just needed a deferral to push out the timeline. The Cloud PAL
team also found that several of the teams asked for exemptions because they did
not have development resources for the adoption effort, so they were able to
provide extra support to those teams and help with development.

## Positive outcomes

### Success for end users

The transition resulted in many tangible benefits for the end user.

- IBM Cloud’s NPS score improved by 57% in the first three months after the
  transition.
- They reduced seven steps from user journeys and improved the average time to
  provision a service by 4%.
- End users were 210% more likely to rate services as “powerful,” “innovative,”
  and “secure” than before, and 180% less likely to rate them as “elaborate” or
  “corporate.”
- In a brand test, 88% of users preferred the new screens.
- IBM Cloud also saw an 18% reduction in support tickets in areas where teams
  implemented and followed Carbon 10 and Cloud PAL guidance.

### Widespread adoption

As of January 2021, 116 of the 155 services have adopted Carbon 10. Twenty-one
of the remaining services have approved exceptions and will never adopt. The
remaining services are continuing to work on a plan for adoption.

### Operational efficiency

IBM Cloud estimates their design and development teams saved 2,000 hours per
pattern, making them 80% more efficient than coding or designing screens from
scratch. Cloud PAL created "connected components" that saved teams even more
time. They removed hundreds of lines of code from each usage since these
components had APIs built in, and they created both visual and data consistency
across the platform.

## Next steps

Cloud PAL is supporting adoption for the few teams that have been delayed. They
are also focusing on continuously improving and developing new components and
patterns for their services.
