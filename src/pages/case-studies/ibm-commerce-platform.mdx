## Summary

The [IBM.com](http://ibm.com/) Commerce Platform team spent 3 three months
transitioning their checkout flow to use Carbon to improve their conversion rate
and overall product experience. They took an iterative approach,
starting first with small, isolated features to get comfortable designing and
developing with Carbon. Next they replaced existing elements with Carbon
components. Once all the components had been transitioned, the team focused on
updating page structure and layout.

Since the Carbon implementation, the team’s delivery cycle has sped up and they spend
less time on QA. Their product is now aligned with the
other [IBM.com](http://ibm.com/) experiences that use Carbon,
creating a consistency of experience. Their conversion rate increased by 5% and
more than 50% of customers are converting to purchase, which puts them on par
with industry benchmarks.

## The Challenge

### Project goals

The [IBM.com](http://ibm.com) Commerce Platform team had a mission — to improve
the completion rate for their checkout flow. They knew there were usability
issues in the checkout process but they also wanted to add new features.

By aligning their checkout flow with the Carbon Design System, they could add
new features in a consistent way and make a lot of small improvements, which
would have a large impact on the completion rate and therefore revenue.

The team aimed to do this by decreasing clicks, increasing device compatibility,
introducing high-value features, and fixing existing bugs. An additional goal
was to reduce the amount of time IBM support was spending manually identifying
and resolving order issues.

### Analytics and research

Site analytics helped identify existing issues in the checkout process. There
were key issues to address during the transition to Carbon:

- There was a lack of visual and information hierarchy on the page.
- Critical information was missing when users encountered an error, and this
  blocked them from moving forward.
- Customers felt the checkout experience was unreliable, and couldn't quickly
  find what they wanted, so they abandoned the flow.

### Competitors

The Commerce team knew their eCommerce marketplace was falling behind
competitors, in both market share and user experience. Competitors had been
moving to a more modern experience that used data given by customers to
pre-populate fields, which significantly reduced the number of clicks. The team
used this project to strategically update their product to be able to better
compete in the marketplace.

## Proposed solution

### Carbon transition

The Carbon implementation would make the interface more clear, meaning users wouldn’t
get lost in the flow and would be able to find what they needed. It also would
align key pages before, during, and after the checkout process, creating a sense
of continuity. The team hypothesized that as a result, users would be less
likely to defect.

The team mapped out their transition to Carbon, focusing at first on a core set
of pages. While implementing Carbon components and aligning to the IBM Design
Language, they took the opportunity to reevaluate their typography and
illustrations. By improving their type hierarchy and illustrations they hoped to
transform a somewhat dry experience to something delightful, while building more
confidence and trust in the interface itself.

### High value features

The second part of the solution was identifying high impact features they could
implement in tandem with the Carbon transition. Many of these features were
self-contained and so they paired well with the overall transition to Carbon, as
the team learned to design and develop with the design system.

The global address form was one of these features. The new form validated
addresses as users entered them, giving users confidence that they’d input the
correct address. Additionally, the support team no longer had to manually follow
up on invalid addresses, making the experience better for everyone.

## The approach

The transition to Carbon was an iterative process. Rather than updating the
entire UI at one time, the Commerce Platform team transitioned their product
slowly and tactfully. By adopting Carbon iteratively, they were able to see
which changes made substantial impacts and use that to inform their roadmap and
subsequent changes.

### Educate on the design system

Before jumping into adopting Carbon, it was important to spend time learning
about and getting comfortable with Carbon. Shixie Shi Trofimov, the design lead
of the transition project, led the developers through a crash course to align on
definitions and terminology. She wanted designers and developers to speak the
same language as they worked through a set of design specifications.

### Start small

The adoption process started with one modal. Instead of redesigning an existing
feature, they identified a high value, self-contained, new feature to develop
from scratch. The modal solved an important usability issue by allowing users to
change their country during checkout, but it also provided the developers a
simple and non-disruptive entry point into adopting Carbon. It also meant they
didn’t have to worry about breaking existing functionality in production and had
a safe place to experiment and ship.

The process of designing to shipping the modal with Carbon took about a month
because it was the team’s first experience with using Carbon and they were
getting up to speed.

### Mix new with old

The first new Carbon modal was placed on an existing page. It was an easy way
for the team to get started and begin shipping new pieces. Mixing new with old
wasn’t disruptive for users. Because the changes were implemented in small
passes, users may not have even noticed that the experience had changed and
returning users did not have to relearn the interface. Also, mixing the
experiences meant that got the team to their final result faster.

### Iterate, iterate, iterate

Rather than updating all of the pages at once, the team took an iterative
approach. By starting with fresh features that integrated with the old UI, the
team could ship pieces iteratively.

The first stage involved switching individual components to their Carbon
version, starting with input fields then buttons. After transitioning the
individual components, the page structure and layout was updated.

With this approach, the Commerce team was able to refresh their product’s
experience, set the stage for larger future changes, and complete the project in
only three months.

## Benefits

There have been several benefits from the transition to Carbon for both the
Commerce team's own workflow and process, and the user experience. The team
especially found value in the impact of their delivery speed and need for QA.

### Faster delivery

The entire process for implementing Carbon took only three months and since the transition, the
team’s development cycle has sped up. By using Carbon, the developers are
placing pre-built components and can therefore focus on more important issues
instead of taking the time to build out each element and component.

</Row>

### Minimal QA

Once the team had been fully onboarded to Carbon, delivery required only minimal
design QA because they were using components straight out of the box.

### Continuity in experience

The project vastly improved the continuity in user experience with other IBM
touchpoints, including Support and My IBM. These experiences now feel continuous
and intuitive for users.

Within the Commerce Platform flow, pages are also unified and organized in the
same way, providing familiarity and a feeling of dependability.

## Positive outcomes

After the Carbon transition, more than 50% of customers are converting to
purchase, which is on par with industry benchmarks. The conversion rate was
raised by 5% which has led to a large increase in orders and revenue.

## Next steps

The Commerce Team is currently working on improvements experience of their
configuration page. The next round of visual design improvements will focus on
better aligning their interface with the
[Carbon for IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom//)
style models.
