We’re developing case studies to explore the adoption and
implementation of Carbon in products and digital experiences.

</PageDescription>

## Introduction

Our goal in creating case studies is two-fold. Firstly, we believe that by
seeing how other teams have adopted Carbon and built workflows, you’ll be
inspired by their methods for your own adoption of Carbon. Secondly, we aim to
show you the true business value of using a design system, and how you can
reduce time to market, by leveraging reductions in design, development, and
testing time.

## Future case studies

We have several case studies in progress, but if you have an idea for a case
study, or would like to contribute your own story,
[reach out to us](mailto:carbon@us.ibm.com) and let us know.
