## About Community components

These components are developed and maintained by members of the broader Carbon community. For support, contact the contributors listed on each page. They are not supported by the core Carbon team.

These components may change over time, and they may be incomplete or experimental. For work that has been approved for universal use by the Carbon governance board, see [Carbon components](/components/overview).
