## Add a chart using the GitHub UI

1. In the
   [index folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/chart-index)
   of the carbon-website GitHub repo, open your team folder. Create a folder if
   your team doesn’t have one yet.
2. Click `Add file` (top right), then `Create new file`.
3. Name your file `chart-name.yml`, where _chart-name_ is the name of your
   chart.
4. Copy and paste the following template into the `Edit new file` section of the
   page and fill out the correct information for your component.

   ```
   name: chart name
   website_url: >-
     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)
   code_url: >-
     url of component code on GitHub (if any)
   maintainer: name of maintainer team
   description: >-
     short description of purpose and usage of chart
   chart_type: choose one of Comparisons | Trends | Part-to-whole | Correlations | Connections | Geospatial | Other
   complexity: choose one of Basic | Advanced
   platform: Web
   aliases:
     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a "alluvial" chart might be "flow")
   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z
   ```

5. Once done, click the green `Commit new file` button at the bottom.

After submitting the PR for the data, you should upload a thumbnail image.

1. Go back to your team folder in the
   [index](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/chart-index).
2. Inside your team folder, open the `images` folder.
3. In the top right, click `Add file` then `Upload files` to upload your image
   to that page then submit the PR. Note: name your image file with the same
   name as the chart (e.g. `chart-name.png` to match `component-name.yml`). Your
   image should be 320px x 240px.

And you’re done! The Carbon team will review and merge the PR.

If you’re unsure about how to make a PR through GitHub, create an issue in the
repo instead and we’ll help you out. Be sure to include all the necessary
component information and images.
