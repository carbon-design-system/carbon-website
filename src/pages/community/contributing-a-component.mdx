## Add a component using the GitHub UI

1. In the
   [index folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/index)
   of the carbon-website GitHub repo, open your team folder (or create one if
   your team doesn’t have on yet).
2. On the next page, in the top right above the the table click `Add file` then
   `Create new file`.
3. Name your file `component-name.yml`.
4. Copy and paste this template into the “Edit new file” section of the page and
   fill out the correct information for your component.
   ```
   name: component name
   website_url: >-
     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)
   code_url: >-
     url of component code on GitHub
   maintainer: name of maintainer team
   description: >-
     short description of purpose and usage of component
   framework: choose one of Vanilla | Angular | React | Vue
   design_asset: choose one of Sketch | Axure | Adobe XD | Figma
   platform: Web
   aliases:
     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a "card" component might be "tile")
   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z
   ```
5. Once done, click the green `Create new file` button at the bottom.
6. After submitting the PR for the data, you’ll need to upload your image. Go
   back to your team folder in the
   [index folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/index).
7. Inside your team folder click on the `images` folder.
8. In the top right, click `Add file` then `Upload files` then upload your image
   to that page then submit the PR by clicking the green `Commit changes` button
   at the bottom. Note: name you image file with the same name as the component
   (e.g. `component-name.png` to match `component-name.yml`).
9. And you’re done! The Carbon team will review and merge the PR.

If you’re unsure about how to make a PR through GitHub then create an issue in
the repo instead and we’ll help you out. Be sure to include all the necessary
component information and images.
