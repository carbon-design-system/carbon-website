Anyone can add assets to the community component index. Maintainers can submit a
short pull request in GitHub to add components to the index.

## Add a component using the GitHub UI

1. In the
   [index folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/index)
   of the carbon-website GitHub repo, open your team folder. Create a folder if
   your team doesn’t have one yet).
2. On the next page, click `Add file` (top right) then `Create new file`.
3. Name your file `component-name.yml`, where _component-name_ is the name of
   your component.
4. Copy and paste the following template into the `Edit new file` section of the
   page and fill out the correct information for your component.

   ```
   name: component name
   website_url: >-
     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)
   code_url: >-
     url of component code on GitHub
   maintainer: name of maintainer team
   description: >-
     short description of purpose and usage of component
   framework: choose one of Vanilla | Angular | React | Vue
   design_asset: choose one of Sketch | Axure | Adobe XD | Figma
   platform: Web
   aliases:
     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a "card" component might be "tile")
   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z
   ```

5. Once done, click the green `Commit new file` button at the bottom.

After submitting the PR for the data, you should upload a thumbnail image. Go
back to your team folder in the
[index](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/data/index).

1. Inside your team folder click the `images` folder.
2. In the top right, click `Add file` then `Upload files` to upload your image
   to that page then submit the PR. Note: name your image file with the same
   name as the component (e.g. `component-name.png` to match
   `component-name.yml`).

And you’re done! The Carbon team will review and merge the PR.

If you’re unsure about how to make a PR through GitHub, create an issue in the
repo instead and we’ll help you out. Be sure to include all the necessary
component information and images.
