## A new community experience - sunny

Carbon relies heavily on our community to contribute to and grow the system;
therefore, we are making contributions easier by releasing a new platform. The
new [Carbon platform](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/) allows maintainers
to classify libraries and assets by applying a common schema allowing all assets
in both core and local systems (previously referred to as PALs) to be documented
in one experience. The platform catalogs now include core and local systems,
enabling teams to access documentation for all indexed assets and libraries
without leaving the platform.
