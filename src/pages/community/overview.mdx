## About Community

Here we share work developed and maintained by the Carbon community. Our goal is to surface future resources and get them into the hands of teams who will use them and refine them.

You can help elevate these resources by working with the maintainers to contribute feedback, code, and design. Through contributions, feedback, and adoption this work may become a core part of the Carbon Design System.

Currently, part of this content is behind the IBM firewall but we are working on ways to make it open-source and available to all.
