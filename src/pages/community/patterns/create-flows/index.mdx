## Standard creation

Standard creation is used in simple creation tasks when no stepped guidance is needed and the input fields are directly related to each other.

### Modal

If there are only one or two options to be made during a creation, use a small, standard modal overlaying the content where the creation was initiated. Avoid scrolling inside a modal.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

### Side panel

Consider using a side panel to take advantage of the added screen real estate and keep the user in the context of where they are working. You may choose to use either the slide in or slide over panels.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Full page

If your creation flow consists of multiple fields and/or supporting imagery, consider the full page option to take full advantage of the screen’s available real estate.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

## Multistep creation

If the creation task is complex, consider whether breaking the process up into steps could help the user. Consider displaying related or dependant options together.

Multistep creation follows the same principles as [Standard creation](#standard-creation), with the addition of steps.

### Side panel

Consider using a side panel to take advantage of the added screen real estate and keep the user in the context of where they are working. You may choose to use either the slide in or slide over panels.

### Full-page multistep

If your creation flow consists of multiple fields and/or supporting imagery, consider the full page option to take full advantage of the screen’s available real estate.

### Button position

On a larger screen, buttons should always remain visible to the user.

Buttons should be located in the top right and should stick upon scrolling.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<img
  src="/images/10.gif"
  alt="Button position in context"
  title="Button position in context"
  style="padding:3rem"
/>

</Column>
</Row>

</Column>
</Row>

When the full-page dialog is viewed in mobile, the buttons are positioned at the bottom of the screen.

<Column colLg={8}>

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Including an image or illustration

If including a supporting image or illustration, place the image on the right-hand side.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of supporting image placement](images/15.png)

<Caption>Example of supporting image placement</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Show all available options toggle

The toggle should be used to avoid overwhelming users, while still allowing users to access all options. It can be applied to the [side panel](#side-panel) and the [full page](#full-page) dialog.

Consider having a minimal set of options visible by default, offering the ability to chose if the user wants to expose more options.

If the user switches to this mode, remember this for when they next perform the same task.

### Confirmation

A notification banner can be presented to visually confirm when any create action is a success.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Pre-create

A pre-create step occurs before the create flow starts. A common pre-create step is **Create from template**.

A pre-create step is usually combined with a [full-page create flow](#full-page). It can also be used in combination with a [side panel create flow](#full-page). A pre-create step can be used in combination with a single-step or multistep create flow. A multistep flow starts after the pre-create step is complete.

Consider reminding users of the option they choose in pre-create in the rest of the create flow.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a pre-create view](images/Precreate1.png)

<Caption>Example of a pre-create view</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Aim to limit the number of pre-create options. If there is a very large number of options, pre-create options can be sorted into groups.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of pre-create with groups of tiles](images/Precreate2.png)

<Caption>Example of pre-create with groups of tiles</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

If necessary, a dropdown selection box or similar component can be required before the pre-create options.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>
