## Community patterns

These patterns are developed and maintained by members of the Carbon community. For support, contact the maintainers listed on each page. They are not supported by the core Carbon team.

These patterns may change over time, and they may be incomplete or experimental. For work that has been approved for universal use by the Carbon governance board, see [Carbon patterns](/patterns/overview).
