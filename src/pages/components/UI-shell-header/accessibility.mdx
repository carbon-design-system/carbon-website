  This header is part of the Carbon UI shell. A shell is a collection of
  components shared by all products within a platform.
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']

Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard UI shell header component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

The Carbon header bakes in keyboard interaction, including a
skip-to-main-content mechanism. Carbon also supports assistive technologies such
as screen readers by setting labeling and page structure.

### Keyboard interaction

Each element in the header can be reached by the `Tab` key. A "Skip to main
content" link appears when a keyboard user first tabs into the page. Links and
icons are activated by `Enter`. Icons can also be activated by `Space`.

  Pressing the Tab key reveals a 'Skip to main' link and then moves between
  other header elements.

### Regions

</Row>

### Labeling

Carbon provides default names for each icon-only button in the header, and these
names are revealed on hover or focus. Interactions for some header components
are covered under other component topics such as
[search](/components/search/usage),
[notifications](/components/notifications/usage), and the
[UI shell right panel switcher](components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/#switcher).

## Design recommendations

For every product, there should be a one-time design exercise to annotate the UI
shell keyboard interaction. This is an important step to carry out, since header
functionality and component names vary significantly between products, even
though they appear similar until interacted with. Annotating expected behavior
increases consistent implementation. Where the product does not deviate from the
standard Carbon implementation, it can merely be annotated that the behaviour
matches what is in the 'How Carbon works' section.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Annotate the header, even if your design matches the default Carbon UI shell
  header behavior.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Once a product-specific header annotation exists, individual product pages only
need to annotate the header if something differs.

Where the header deviates from the default Carbon behavior or labeling, it
should be annotated. Such annotations could call out different labels for icons
or indicate interaction changes such as keyboard navigation.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Carbon uses the HTML 5 `header` component instead of an ARIA landmark to set
  the region.
- Carbon includes the "Skip to main content" link as the first item on the page
  with a `tabindex="0"`, but hides it through CSS until it receives focus.
