description:
  This header is part of the Carbon UI shell. A shell is a collection of
  components shared by all products within a platform.
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']

Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard UI shell header component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

The Carbon header bakes in keyboard interaction, including a skip-to-main-content
mechanism. Carbon also supports assistive technologies such as screen readers by setting labeling and page structure.

### Keyboard interaction

Each element in the header can be reached by `Tab` key. A "Skip to main content" link appears when a
keyboard user first tabs into the page. Links and icons are activated by `Enter`. Icons can also be
activated by `Space`.

### Regions

</Row>

### Labeling

Carbon provides default names for each icon-only button in the header, and these names are revealed on hover or focus. Interactions for some header components are covered under other component topics: [search](/components/search/usage), [notifications](/components/notifications/usage), [switcher](components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/#switcherswitcher).

## Design recommendations

For every product, there should be a one-time design exercise to annotate the UI shell keyboard interaction.
This is an important step to carry out, since header functionality and component names vary significantly between products, even though they appear similar until interacted with. Annotating expected behavior increases consistent implementation. Where the product does not deviate from the standard Carbon implementation, it can merely be annotated that the behaviour matches what is in the 'How Carbon works' section.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Once a product-specific header annotation exists, individual product pages only need to annotate if something differs.

Where UI shell header functionality deviates from the default Carbon behavior described, it should be annotated. Such annotations could call out different labels for icons or indicate interaction changes, where they exist. For example, some products may alter the keyboard interaction of some UI Shell header components like menus or side panels.

</Column>
</Row>


## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Carbon uses the HTML 5 `header` component instead of an ARIA landmark to set the region.
- Carbon includes the Skip to main content link as the first item on the page with a `tabindex="0"`, but hides it through CSS until it receives focus.
