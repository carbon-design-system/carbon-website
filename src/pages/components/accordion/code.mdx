## Overview

You can build an accordion using a combination of the `Accordion` and
`AccordionItem` components. The `Accordion` components accepts a list of
`AccordionItem` components as `children` and each `AccordionItem` is responsible
for displaying the accordion's heading and panel content.

You can configure the accordion item's heading using the `title` prop.
Everything you pass in as a child of `AccordionItem` will be rendered in the
accordion's panel.

```jsx
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from "carbon-components-react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  );
}
```

## Skeleton state

You can use the `AccordionSkeleton` component to render a skeleton variant of an
accordion. This is useful to display while content in your accordion is being
fetched from an external resource like an API.

```jsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionSkeleton,
} from "carbon-components-react";

function MyComponent({ isLoading }) {
  if (isLoading) {
    return <AccordionSkeleton open count={3} />;
  }

  return (
    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  );
}
```

## Component API

### Accordion props

| Prop      | Type                     | Required | Default | Description                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| align     | `'start'` &#124; `'end'` | –        | –       | Specify the alignment of the accordion heading title and chevron  |
| children  | `node`                   | `true`   | –       | –                                                                 |
| className | `string`                 | –        | –       | Specify an optional className to be applied to the container node |

Additional props passed into `Accordion` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion container.

### Accordion align

In rare cases, you may need to specify the alignment of the icon in the
accordion. You can use the `align` prop to specify the side where the icon
should be placed.

_Note: This prop must not be used to create a tree view or set of nested
accordions._

```jsx
<Accordion align="start">
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Accordion className

The `className` prop passed into `Accordion` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion container. This is useful for specifying a custom class
name for layout.

```jsx
<Accordion className="custom-class">
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A">Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionItem props

| Prop      | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                                       |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| children  | `node`    | `true`   | –       | –                                                                 |
| className | `string`  | –        | –       | Provide an optional className to be applied to the container node |
| open      | `boolean` | –        | –       | Specify whether the `AccordionItem` should be open                |
| title     | `node`    | –        | –       | Provide the value of the accordion item heading                   |

Additional props passed into `AccordionItem`, such as `onClick`, will be passed
through to the underlying accordion header.

### AccordionItem className

The `className` prop passed into `AccordionItem` will be forwarded along to the
underlying accordion header. This is useful for specifying a custom class name
for layout.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel A" className="custom-class">
    Panel A
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionItem title

You can use the `title` prop to specify the accordion item's heading. The
default behavior is to pass in a `string` as the title, however you can also
pass in a `node`.

_Note: A custom title prop that renders an interactive element is considered an
accessibility violation. For more information, visit our [reference
section](#why-is-interactive-content-in-a-heading-considered-an-accessibility-violation) below._

```jsx
<Accordion align="start">
  <AccordionItem title={() => <span>Panel A</span>}>Panel A</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel B">Panel B</AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Panel C">Panel C</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### AccordionSkeleton props

| Prop      | Type                     | Required | Default | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| align     | `'start'` &#124; `'end'` | –        | `'end'` | Specify the alignment of the accordion heading title and chevron   |
| className | `string`                 | –        | –       | Provide an optional className to be applied to the container node  |
| count     | `boolean`                | –        | `4`     | Specify the number of items to render                              |
| open      | `boolean`                | –        | `true`  | Specify whether the skeleton should display the first item as open |

Additional props passed into `AccordionSkeleton` will be forwarded along to the
underlying skeleton container.

### AccordionSkeleton className

The `className` prop passed into `AccordionSkeleton` will be forwarded along to
the underlying skeleton container. This is useful for specifying a custom class
name for layout.

```jsx
<AccordionSkeleton className="custom-class" open count={3} />
```

  Why is interactive content in a heading considered an accessibility violation?
</h3>

When using the `title` prop from `Accordion`, it is possible to render arbitrary
markup within the accordion header. The accordion header itself is rendered as a
`<button>` and is considered an interactive element.

If you render an interactive element inside this header, then it becomes
nested inside the `<button>`. Common examples of this are buttons or links.
Rendering interactive content inside the accordion heading is not reachable
via a keyboard or screen reader.
