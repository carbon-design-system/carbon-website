<PageDescription>

The AI label indicates an instance of AI in the UI. It enables AI transparency
through the visual recognition the AI icon and is the key pathway to AI
explainability by acting as the trigger for the explainability popover.

## Overview

The AI label is more than just an indicator of AI instances in the UI. It’s also
a consistent pathway to AI explainability. Its behavior is flexible enough to
cooperate with the behaviors and interactions within existing products.

The AI label is intended for any scenario where something is being generated by
or with AI to reinforce AI transparency, accountability, and explainability at
any interface level. This also enables more effective recognition and recall of
AI instances in a way that is identifiable across any IBM product.

### Variants

| Variant   | Purpose                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Default_ | The default AI label used in most components and container type use cases. It can be used for both broad and focused AI instances. |
| _Inline_  | A specific type of AI label used only in small focused AI instances and often paired inline with text content.                     |

### When to use

#### Mark AI-generated content

AI transparency is key, and the AI label is an accessible, interactive element
that marks any AI instance presented in the interface.

#### Provides a consistent visual reference point for AI

For recognition and recall, users need a consistent, identifiable visual
reference to look to when they need to understand more details about how the AI
was built.

#### A pathway to explainability

Users must clearly understand how to access more details about how an AI was
built. By providing a bridge to explainability from the AI label, users are
given a recognizable location to learn more about the AI model.

### When not to use

#### Don’t use the AI label as decoration

These are strictly intended to indicate any time a modality or component is
using AI.

#### Don’t modify AI label behaviors

The AI label is intended as a pathway to explainability. Any additional
behaviors can set unclear and inconsistent expectations.

#### Don’t use the AI label as a trigger for AI actions

The AI label is not a UI icon and should not be used with buttons or other
call-to-actions to trigger an AI action like “regenerate.” Those type of AI
actions will have their own UI icons.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Anatomy of AI label](images/ai-label-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **AI indicator / button**: indicates AI is present and is the button trigger
   for the explainability popover. It can be either the default or inline
   variant.
2. **Text label**: the text abbreviation for artificial intelligence which can
   be translated as needed.
3. **Explainability popover**: Area that contains AI explainability content and
   interactive elements.

### Sizing

#### Default sizes

The default AI label spans the range of UI icons and pictogram sizes. Which size
to use is determined by the prominence and hierarchy of the area it is in or by
its neighboring content such as other buttons. When placed next to other ghost
icon buttons we typically recommend going down one size from the button size so
they are optically weighted the same.

| Default size     | Height (px/rem) |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Mini             | 16 / 1          |
| 2x small (2xs)   | 20 / 1.25       |
| Extra small (xs) | 24 / 1.5        |
| Small (sm)       | 32 / 2          |
| Medium (md)      | 40 / 2.5        |
| Large (lg)       | 48 / 3          |
| Extra large (xl) | 64 / 4          |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Default AI label sizes](images/ai-label-sizes-default.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Inline sizes

The size of the inline AI label text should match the size of the text it is
placed inline with. For example, when inserting the inline AI label into a table
row with 14px font size, you match it with the medium-size inline AI label that
also has a 14px font.

| Inline size | Height (px/rem) | Use case              |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Small (sm)  | 16 / 1          | Paired with 12px type |
| Medium (md) | 18 / 1.125      | Paired with 14px type |
| Large (lg)  | 22 / 1.375      | Paired with 16px type |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Inline AI label sizes](images/ai-label-sizes-inline.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Placement

The AI label should be placed in consistent locations based on modality to help
users identify AI presence in the interface. Consistent placement reinforces
recognition and recall for users. The instructions for these placements assume a
left-to-right reading order. If right-to-left then these placements should be
mirrored.

#### In containers

The AI label should be placed in the upper right of the container with
appropriate margin. Never place the AI label flush to the edges of a container.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an AI label placement in a container](images/ai-label-placement-containers.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### In inputs

Place AI labels on the right side and in the middle of any form inputs
(dropdowns, text or number input, etc.).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an AI label placement in an input](images/ai-label-placement-inputs.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### With other icons

If other icons are present alongside the AI label, then the AI label should be
placed in the far left position of the icon group.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example of an AI label placement with other icons](images/ai-label-placement-icons.png)

</Column>
</Row>

The exception is when the icon has an interaction state that alters its size or
position, like an expandable search or toggle-able sort. In these instances, the
AI label is placed to the right of these exceptions but still to the left of
other icon types.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an AI label placement with search](images/ai-label-placement-icons-exception.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### In data tables

Where the AI label is positioned inside of a data table depends on which parts
of the data are AI generated. For more details, see the
[AI presence](/components/data-table/usage/#ai-presence) section on the data
table component page.

- If the whole table has an AI presence, then place the AI label in the top
  right of the table header.
- If a whole column has an AI presence, then place the AI label in the far right
  of the column header. The sort icon of the table column will now appear to the
  left of the AI label.
- If a whole row has an AI presence, then place the AI label to the far left of
  the row and to the left of any selection or expansion controls.
- If a single cell has an AI presence, then place the AI label inline and left
  to the cell text.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an AI label placement in data tables](images/ai-label-placement-data-table.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### In forms

Where the AI label is placed in a form can vary depending on if the AI presence
is across the whole form or just in certain parts of the form. For more
guidance, see the [AI presence](/components/form/usage/#ai-presence) section on
the form component page.

- If the entire form has an AI presence, then place the AI label in top right of
  the form header.
- If only some parts of the form have an AI presence then the AI label should be
  embedded in the components or sections that are AI-generated.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an AI label placement in forms](images/ai-label-placement-form.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Levels of visibility

The AI label might appear at multiple levels of a page, or it might appear only
once. The content in the AI explainability popover might be focused on a single
AI instance or broadly address multiple instances. All scenarios are acceptable
and possible, but the level of visibility depends on the need for explainability
and/or the need to distinguish AI content from human content.

| Visibility level | Usecase                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Focused_        | Use for individual occurrences of AI within a section         |
| _Broad_          | Use for summarization of AI usage across a section of a page. |

#### Use a focused AI label:

- When the user needs to have an individual AI instance explained.
- When the user needs to distinguish between AI and non-AI content.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a focused AI label instance](images/ai-label-levels-focused.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>

</Caption>

#### Use a broad AI label:

- When users don’t need specific explanations of AI on a per-instance level.
- When the user doesn’t need to act on AI at an instance level.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a broad AI label instance](images/ai-label-levels-broad.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>
  An example of broad AI labeling on a whole column in a data table.
</Caption>

#### Using both focused and broad AI label

Use both focused and broad AI labels when AI surfaces throughout the experience,
but:

- Individual AI instances still need to be explained.
- The user needs to distinguish between AI and non-AI content.
- The user needs to act on AI at an instance level.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## Content

### Localization

The abbreviation `AI` in the AI label stands for the English term
`artificial intelligence`. The abbreviation can be localized for other
languages. Here are some examples of abbreviations in other languages.

- `AI` in Chinese, Indonesia, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish LA
- `IA` in European Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, France French
- `KI` in German
- `ИИ` in Russian, Bulgarian

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Explainability template

The explainability popover is a configurable content area. Carbon for AI
provides a recommended content template for creating your explainability
content. The template is split into four main content sections:

- Overview
- Supporting details
- Artifacts and resources
- Additional actions

_For IBMers only:_ For more information and guidance on designing content for
your explainability popover, see the
[AI explainability popover](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/design-for-ai/carbon-for-ai/ai-explainability-popover)
pattern on Design for AI.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of the AI label in various languages](images/ai-label-explainability-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Behaviors

### States

AI label has three interactive states: **enabled**, **hover**, and **focus**.
The AI label should never be disabled as part of a disabled or read-only state.
Learn more about states on the [style](/components/ai-label/style) tab.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![AI labels shown in their three states](images/ai-label-states.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Enabled (left), hover (middle), focus (right)</Caption>

### Clickable areas

In the default AI label, the clickable area is limited to the icon without any
additional external coverage, such as in a icon-only ghost button. The inline AI
label will have a small amount of extra padding around it included in the click
target area.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![AI label click target](images/ai-label-click-target.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Explainability popover

The popover is the first layer of explainability that is accessed by clicking
the AI label. This provides a consistent up-front way to access explainability
with the ability to dig into more details on-demand. Use this popover any time
AI needs to be explained in your experience.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![An example of an AI explainability popover](images/ai-label-explainability-01.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Opening and dismissing the popover

The AI label is the trigger that opens explainability popover. The interaction
works like a toggletip where the popover remains open until the user clicks or
tabs away from the AI label. For a details on the keyboard interactions of the
explainability popover, see the
[accessibility](/components/ai-label/accessibility#keyboard-interactions) tab.

#### Popover orientation

The popover should auto-position itself to the best orientation on the screen so
that it does not appear out of view for the user. It follows the same alignments
as the primitive caret-tip [popover](/components/popover/usage/#caret-tip).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of various orientations for the explainability popover](images/ai-label-explainability-orientation.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Revert function

Users can manually override AI-suggested content, but they should always be able
to programmatically switch back to the initially suggested AI content. In these
instances, when the content is overridden by the user, the AI presence styling
is removed and the AI label is replaced by a “revert” action icon-only button.
If a user activates the revert action, the AI-generated content will reappear,
along with the AI presence styling and AI label.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>
