No accessibility annotations are needed for breadcrumbs, but keep these
considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom
component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

Each page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`.
The current page, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb
is truncated, the ellipsis button for the overflow menu is in the tab order. See
[overflow menu](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)
for details on its keyboard operation.

### Labeling and regions

Carbon implements each page link as a list item inside a navigation region named
“breadcrumb.” The ellipsis symbol is a button called “more breadcrumbs” which
opens the
[overflow menu](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/).

</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component:

- The Carbon implementation uses an html5 `<nav>` element; this could also be
  achieved with a “navigation” landmark on a `<div>`.
- Each link in the breadcrumb is implemented as an unordered list item so that
  screen readers provide more context.
- The visual / separators do not need to be text (Carbon uses CSS) and are not
  intended to be navigable.
