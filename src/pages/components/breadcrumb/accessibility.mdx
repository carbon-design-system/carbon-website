No accessibility annotations are needed for breadcrumbs, but keep these considerations in mind if you’re modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, which improves the experiences of blind users and others who need to operate via the keyboard API. Carbon also incorporates many other accessibility considerations.

### Keyboard interactions

Each accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse accordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded accordions integrate into the tab order automatically.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Accordions are reached by `Tab` and activated by `Space` and `Enter` keys.

### Labelling and states

The collapsed or expanded state of the accordions is [programmatically set](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#4_1_2) by default, eliminating the need for any [text equivalent](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents/) for the chevron icons.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Carbon handles the accessibility of the chevron  indicators.

## Design annotations

Design annotations are needed for the following instances.

### Headings

Carbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed. See [Indicate heading levels](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-meaning/#heading-levels).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

If accordion titles act as headings, annotate for development.

### Alignment

Carbon chevrons are right-aligned by default, but left-aligned chevrons are more accessible for users with low vision, as the expanded/collapsed indicator is closer to the accordion title. 

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![annotation stating ‘position chevrons on the left of accordion titles'](images/accordion-accessibility-4.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Annotate if the accordion chevrons should be left-aligned.

## Developer considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you’re modifying Carbon or creating a custom component:

* The accordion header has a role of `<button>`, with an `aria-expanded` attribute set to `"true"` or `"false"`.
* The button has an `aria-controls` property set to the unique id of the panel it controls.
* Since accordions are typically grouped together, Carbon puts each button inside a list item in an unordered list, which provides additional context to screen reader users; where only one accordion is used, it should not be put in a list.
* When accordion titles are used as headings, the buttons are also wrapped in an element with an appropriate heading level; ARIA can be used to set both the heading role and the level (via `aria-level`).
* See the [A]RIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#accordion) for more guidance.
