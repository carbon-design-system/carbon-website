Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the standard button component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![example of button keyboard interaction](images/button-accessibility-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Buttons can be reached by `Tab` and selected with `Space` or `Enter`.

### interaction

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![a pointer hovering over an icon-only button shows the name ‘Close’](images/button-accessibility-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Icon-only buttons have their labels exposed automatically on hover and focus.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![an activated button reveals 3 options in a menu](images/button-accessibility-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Button menus are separate components in Carbon. See [Dropdown](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/) and [Overflow menu](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/).

## Design annotations

Design annotations are needed for the following instances.

### Labelling

When buttons do not have a persistent label, they must be annotated with a label that will be exposed on hover or focus.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![a button with a pencil icon has an annotation ‘label=Rename’](images/button-accessibility-4.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Annotate the label for icon-only buttons so the proper tooltip appears.

## Developer considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you’re modifying Carbon or creating a custom component:

* Where links have been ‘repurposed’ as a button, they need to be coded so the `Space` key can also activate (since links are only activated by default by `Enter`).
* Toggle buttons can be accessibility supported by changing the value of `aria-pressed` between `"true"` and `"false"` or with a change of name that
reflects a change in the icon shape (for example: "play" / "pause" )
* See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#button) for more considerations.
