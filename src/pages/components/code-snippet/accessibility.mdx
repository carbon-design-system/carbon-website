The code snippet React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
and violations have been identified as high priority issues. This document will
be updated when these accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. The code snippet copy button can be activated using both the `Space` or
   `Enter` key.
2. The code snippet copy button label accurately describes what the button does.
3. After the button is activated the focus remains on the button since there is
   no change in context.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been
performed on the code snippet React Carbon component.
[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues
have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available
in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
