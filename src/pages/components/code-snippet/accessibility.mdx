## Accessibility considerations

1. The code snippet copy button can be activated using both the `Space` or `Enter` key.
2. The code snippet copy button label accurately describes what the button does.
3. After the button is activated the focus remains on the button since there is no change in context.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been performed on the code snippet React Carbon component. [WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
