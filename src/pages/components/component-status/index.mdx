title: Component status
---

We're reassessing how we maintain the component status page.

We want to make sure it's always showing the most up-to-date information possible, as well as showing you the information you need to make decisions.

In the meantime, rather than providing potentially inaccurate information, we've taken down the status table for individual components.

All of the components you see published under the 'Components' section on the Carbon Design System site are production ready and approved for use in React.
