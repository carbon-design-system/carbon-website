title: Component status
---

We are currently reassessing how we maintain the component status page and so for the meantime, we’ve removed the status table for individual components.

All Carbon components are stable and approved for production in React. For the latest component updates in other frameworks, please refer to the respective repository’s changelog.

We want to make sure that this page includes the information you need to make decisions and that it’s always up-to-date. Please [let us know](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/961) if there is any information in particular you would like to see surfaced here.
