title: Component status
---

We are currently reassessing how we maintain the component status page and so for the meantime, we’ve removed the status table for individual components.

We want to make sure that this page includes the information you need to make decisions and that it’s always up-to-date.

All of the components you see published in “Components” on the Carbon Design System site are production ready and approved for use in React. Status for components in other frameworks can be found in their respective GitHub repos or by contacting their maintainers. 

Please [let us know](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/961) if there is any information in particular you would like to see surfaced here.
