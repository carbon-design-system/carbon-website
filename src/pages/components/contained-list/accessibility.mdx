Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard contained list component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

The default contained list is not interactive, but a number of its variants
include keyboard operation. In all interactive variants, the `Tab` key is used
for navigation, and `Space` or `Enter` are used to activate components.

Users tab between any actionable items in the list, whether each item is itself
clickable or contains an action button (such as ‘delete’). It is possible for
multiple tab stops to exist for each list item.

There are two kinds of filterable contained lists: persistent or expandable.
Both follow the standard Carbon
[search input interaction](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/search/accessibility/),
the difference being that a Filter button hides the input until it is activated
with `Enter` or `Space`.

## Design recommendations

### Indicate when the contained list is clickable

There is no persistent visual indicator that the list items in a contained list
are clickable. To help developers distinguish them from the default contained
list in your designs, annotate where the rows in a list are intended to be
clickable.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- The contained list is implemented as a list (usually a `<ul>`) with each item
  an `<li>`, and the list title associated with the list through use of
  `aria-labelledby`.
- Any operable variant, whether a clickable list or a list with action items, is
  a `<button>` implemented as a child of the `<li>`.
