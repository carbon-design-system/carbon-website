Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard content switcher component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

Like tabs, content switchers can be automatic or manual. In both instances, the
content switcher takes one tab stop, and arrow keys are used to navigate between
content tabs.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Manual and automatic content switchers have the same basic keyboard
  interaction.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Automatic and manual switchers differ in how they are activated. The following
illustration shows what will happen for each variant when a right arrow key is
pressed with the All content tab selected and focused.

For automatic switchers, focus and selection are synchronized. When the user
arrows to a tab, it is selected and the content section under the switcher is
updated in real time.

Manual switchers allow the user to arrow between the content tabs without
updating the content section underneath. When the user right arrows, the All
content tab remains selected while focus moves to the Read tab. In order to
select the Read tab (and update the content section under the switcher) the user
would press `Enter` or `Space`.

<Column colLg={8}>

  The Space and Enter keys are used to select a content tab after arrowing to it
  in a manual variant.

</Column>
</Row>

## Design recommendations

### Indicate which variant to implement

The automatic and manual switchers are visually indistinguishable in a
wireframe, so designers should annotate which variant the team has decided to
implement. Since the choice largely concerns technical considerations about
potential latency when updating the content sectionâ€™s information, architects or
developers should be involved in the discussion.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- The Content switcher is implemented as a `tablist`, with each content tab
  implemented as a `<button>` with a role of `tab`.
- The selected content tab has attributes `aria-selected="true"` and
  `tabindex="0"`. All other tabs have these attribute values set to `"false"`
  and `"-1"`.
- See the
  [ARIA authoring practices guidance for tabs](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tabpanel)
  for more considerations.
- For accessibility considerations for manual content switchers, see
  [Deciding when to make selection automatically follow focus](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_selection_follows_focus).
