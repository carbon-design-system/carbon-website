The content switcher React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
and violations have been identified as high priority issues. This document will
be updated when these accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. Each content switcher tab must have a unique title that clearly describes the
   content panel. This is particularly helpful for users of assistive
   technologies so they have the necessary information to efficiently navigate
   the content.
2. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within
   each content panel.
3. Content authors need to ensure the content that is added to the tab panel is
   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the panel you need to include
   alternative text to pass accessibility testing.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been
performed on the Content Switcher React Carbon Component.
[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues
have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available
in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
