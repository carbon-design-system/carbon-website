## Overview

The content switcher is used to toggle between two or more content sections within the same space on screen. Only one section can be shown at a time.

#### Text

Be concise and specific. Titles have a max of two words.

#### Default selection

Based on usage, there should be a default selection. The default selection is always the first option in a switcher.

#### Content switcher versus toggle

The content switcher is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the [toggle](/components/toggle/usage) which is meant for a “yes/no” or “on/off” binary decision.

#### Content switcher vs tabs

Use tabs when the content on the page is divided into related sections, but without any overlap. Tabs follow the metaphor for sections in a filing cabinet and two tabs wouldn't contain the same sheet of paper. So the role of tabs in information hierarchy is to separate content. Use a contents switchers when you want alternative views of the same content. For example, use a content switcher if you have a single category, such as "E-mail" and you want to divide it into views such as "All", "Read", and "Unread". Another example could to provide a "Preview" and an "Edit" view of the same content. In this example, tabs would emphasise that the two are distinct, whereas a content switcher better communicates that they are different views of the same thing.
