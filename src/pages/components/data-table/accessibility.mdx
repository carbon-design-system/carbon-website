Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard data table component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

There are three data table variants with different interactions. Optional
features like column sorting can appear in any of the variants. Table
[pagination](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/pagination/usage/) is
treated as a separate component.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

For sortable tables, the column headers are reachable by `Tab` and sortable with
`Space` or `Enter`.

### Controls inside tables

Any interactive controls in data cells are in the tab order and maintain normal
keyboard operation. This also applies to expandable table rows, which operate in
the same manner as
[accordions](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordions/usage/)

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![tab order proceeds sequentially through the table row expansion icons then to a link inside an expanded row](images/datatable-accessibility-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Links, inputs, and other interactive controls inside tables operate by keyboard
as normal.

### Labeling and updates

If columns are sortable, the sort symbols appear on hover or focus. A sorted
column retains an indicator until it is no longer sorted.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![The Rule column header has focus and shows a sortable icon, and the Status column header has a 'sorted ascending' icon](images/datatable-accessibility-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Sort indicators appear on hover and focus. A sorted column is indicated
visually.

## Design recommendations

Since there is no persistent visual indicator that a table is sortable,
designers need to annotate if a table should be implemented with sortable column
headers.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![the header row is annotated 'sortable headers'](images/datatable-accessibility-4.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Annotate if a table is sortable.

## Development considerations

Keep this in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component:

- Column sorting indicators are matched programmatically using `aria-sort`
- Remember to supply an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` to the
  `Table` component to comply with
  [accessible naming](https://able.ibm.com/rules/archives/latest/doc/en-US/aria_accessiblename_exists.html)
- See the
  [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#table)
  for more considerations
