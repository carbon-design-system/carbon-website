No accessibility annotations are needed for dropdowns, but keep these
considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom
component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

A dropdown component and its variants multiselect and combo box are reached by
`Tab`, with navigation of the options by `Up` and `Down` arrow keys. However,
the keys for opening the component and selecting its options are different for
each variant.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Dropdowns are in the tab order and operable by Up and Down arrow keys, once
  opened.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Dropdown

The default dropdown opens with `Enter`, `Space`, or `Down arrow`. If an option
is already selected or if `Down arrow` is used to open the component, the focus
moves to the first or currently selected option. Arrow keys change options, and
any option with focus is selected with `Space` or `Enter`, which also closes the
dropdown. Pressing `Esc` or `Tab` closes a dropdown without changing the
selected option.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  The Space and Enter keys can be used to open dropdowns and also select an
  option with focus. Esc cancels and closes the interaction.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Multiselect

The multiselect opens with `Down arrow`, or with the `Enter` or `Space` keys,
which are also used to toggle the selection of any option. Focus handling is the
same as with the default dropdown: focus is only moved to the options list if an
item is already selected or if the multiselect is opened with the `Down arrow`.
Once items are selected, a tag appears in the field, showing a numerical
representation of the number of items selected along with an ‘x’. Pressing `Esc`
closes the multiselect. Pressing `Delete` while focus is in the collapsed field
will clear all selected options.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>

</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Combo box

The combo box’s operation (as well as the filterable multiselect's) is quite
different, since it is a combination of a text input and a dropdown. `Enter` or
the `Up` or `Down arrow` keys will open the list of options, as will typing any
matching character or string of characters (which will also filter the list to
only show items that match the typed string). Focus handling in the options list
is similar to the default dropdown: focus is only moved to the options list if
an item is already selected, a matching string is entered, or if opened with an
arrow key. Pressing `Esc` will collapse the list or clear the typed string.
Pressing `Enter` will select a highlighted option and collapse the list. (If
nothing is highlighted in the list, pressing `Enter` will toggle the combo box
open and closed.) `Space` cannot be used for selecting, as pressing it will
submit a space character into the filter string.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Combo boxes can be opened with the Enter or Up and Down arrow keys. Enter
  selects the highlighted option in the list. Esc clears the input and closes
  the combo box.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- The dropdown and multiselect variant use a `button` with
  `aria-haspopup="listbox"`.
- Ensure the ID of the referenced label, such as "Access role" in the code
  example, is unique when there are multiple dropdown components on a page
- The combo box uses an input with `role="combo box"`,
  `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"` and
  `autocomplete="off"`.
- The combo box uses `aria-controls` for a div with `role="listbox"`.
- All variants use `aria-expanded` to track the state of the listbox.
- See the
  [ARIA authoring practices for combo box](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/)
  for more considerations.
