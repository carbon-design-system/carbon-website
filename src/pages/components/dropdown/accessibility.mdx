The dropdown React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success
criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and violations have been identified
as high priority issues. This document will be updated when these

## Accessibility considerations

1. Avoid very long option names to facilitate understandability and perceivability.
2. Do not use the same word or phrase at the beginning of a set of options.
3. Avoid options that contain headings and interactive elements such as links, buttons, or checkboxes.
4. If the dropdown is a required field include the [aria-required property](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA2.html) and indicate that it is a required field and use the validation message for input errors.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been performed on the dropdown React Carbon Component. [WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
