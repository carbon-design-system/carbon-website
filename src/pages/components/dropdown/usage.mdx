## Overview

There are three different variants of dropdowns that support various kinds of
functionality—dropdown, multiselect, and combo box.

### Variants

| Variant                     | Purpose                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Dropdown](#dropdown)       | Allows the user to select one option from a list.                                        |
| [Multiselect](#multiselect) | Allows the user to select multiple options from a list and filter.                       |
| [Combo box](#combo-box)     | Allows the user to make a selection from a list of suggested, likely, or desired values. |

### When to use

- Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels.
  The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a
  stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.

### When not to use

- It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two options to choose
  from. In this case, use a
  [radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/code)
  group instead.
- Do not nest dropdowns or use them to display overly complex information. Keep
  option selections as straight forward as possible.
- Consider using a
  [select](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/usage) if most
  of your experience is form-based or frequently used on mobile platforms. The
  native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is
  also easier to use on a mobile platform

## Formatting

### Anatomy

Dropdowns are composed of four distinct sections—assistive text like labels or
helper text, a field, a menu, and options contained within the menu. Labels and
helper text can guide the user to make an informed decision when making a
selection.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default style dropdown anatomy](images/dropdown-usage-1.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid style dropdown anatomy](images/dropdown-usage-1-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Labels:** Text that informs the user what to expect in the list of dropdown
   options.
2. **Helper text:** Assistive text to help the user choose the right selection.
3. **Field:** Persists when the dropdown is open or closed.
4. **Option:** A choice for the user, shown with other choices in a menu.
5. **Menu:** A list of options to choose from, displayed as an open state. from.

### Styling

There are two styles of dropdown inputs, default and fluid. They share the same
functionality but look visually different, influencing where to use them.

| Style   | Appearance                                                                                                               | Use case                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default | A traditional style where the label is positioned outside and above the input field.                                     | Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |
| Fluid   | An alternative style where the label is placed inside of the input field and is stacked inline with the user input text. | Use in expressive moments, fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar.                                     |

### Sizing

#### Default input heights

There are three Default dropdown height sizes: small, medium, and large.
Supporting three different dropdown sizes gives you more flexibility when
structuring layouts. However, use a consistent size for all form components on
the same page. For example, if you are using a medium size dropdown also use the
same size text inputs, buttons, and so on. When in doubt, use the default medium
size height.

| Default size | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small (sm)   | 32 / 2          | Use when space is constricted or when placing a dropdown in a form that is long and complex.                                                                                       |
| Medium (md)  | 40 / 2.5        | This is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.                                                                                      |
| Large (lg)   | 48 / 3          | Choose this size when there is a lot of space to work with. This size is typically used in simple forms or when a dropdown is placed by itself on a page, for example as a filter. |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown sizes in the defauult style](images/dropdown-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

When the menu is open, each option in the menu should be the same height as the
field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown field and option size relationship](images/dropdown-usage-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Fluid inputs heights

In the fluid dropdown, there is only one input height but there are two menu
item sizes–default and condensed.

| Fluid size | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default    | 64 / 4          | Use when there are fewer menu options in expressive moments.                          |
| Condensed  | 40 / 2.5        | Use when there are many menu options so more can be viewed at once without scrolling. |

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Dropdown sizes in the fluid style](images/dropdown-usage-3-fluid.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Width

There is no minimum or maximum width for a dropdown. The width can be customized
appropriately for its context.

### Placement

Field containers should vertically align with other form components on a page.
Whether it aligns flush to grid columns or hangs in the gutters depends on the
style of dropdown you are using.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do align default style dropdown containers flush to the grid so the input label aligns with other type on the page.">

![Do not use fluid components with vertical or horizontal spacing between them.](images/dropdown-usage-4-dont-fluid.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

## Content

### Main elements

#### Labels

- Labels inform users what to expect in the list of dropdown options.
- Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a single line of text.

#### Helper text

- Helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in choosing the
  right selection from the dropdown menu.
- Helper text is always available when the dropdown field is focused and appears
  underneath the label.
- Use sentence-style capitalization and write the text as full sentences with
  punctuation, unless space is limited.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown assistive labels, helper text or none.](images/dropdown-usage-5.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Field placeholder text

- Placeholder text is presented in the field by default if no selection has been
  made from the dropdown. This is important to have in case the dropdown does
  not have a label above it.
- Use clear placeholder text for the dropdown trigger so that users understand
  the purpose.

#### Options in a menu

- Describe the dropdown option succinctly in one line of text.
- Never use decorative images or icons within a dropdown.
- We recommend presenting the options in alphabetical order.

### Optional versus required fields

All fields in a form are assumed required, and optional fields are tagged. For
more information, see the
[form component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage) usage
guidance.

### Overflow content

Avoid having multiple lines of text in a dropdown. If the text is too long for
one line, add an ellipsis (…) for overflow content, and accompany with a
browser-based tooltip to show the full string of text.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown overflow text truncation.](images/dropdown-usage-6.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Universal behaviors

The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the variants.
For behaviors that are unique to each variant, see the sections below.

### Direction

A dropdown can open up or down depending on its position on the screen. For
example, if the dropdown appears at the bottom and close to the edge of the
interface, the menu expands upward to avoid being cropped. By default, our
dropdowns open downward.

### Elevation

The dropdown menu has a style called `box-shadow` that is placed behind the menu
when open to give the menu a perceived higher elevation than the content that
may fall behind it. Box-shadow is also used in other components that have
overlayed menus, such as the overflow menu and date picker calendar. The SCSS
for box-shadow is `0 2px 6px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.2)`.

### Scrolling behavior

Scroll bars may not always be enabled so we recommend showing 50% of the last
option's container height to indicate there is more to see within the menu. We
recommend starting a scroll at the sixth option in the menu list, but this may
vary based on your specific use case.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown scrolling menu option cutoff.](images/dropdown-usage-7a.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### States

Dropdowns, combo boxes, and multiselects have a series of states for both their
fields and menus: **enabled**, **hover**, **focus**, **error**, **warning**,
**disabled**, **skeleton**, and **read-only**. For more information on states,
visit the
[interactive states](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/style#interactive-states)
guidance on the style tab.

### Vertical dividers in input fields

Vertical dividers act as a visual separator between interactive elements in an
input field. These vertical dividers are only present between two interactive
elements, they should not be introduced between non-interactive elements like
error states, other non-interactive icons, or buttons.

A divider will also be present to the left of the leftmost interactive item set,
even if it's next to a non-interactive item.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do introduce a vertical divider between two interactive elements in an input field.">

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

#### Dropdown:

- The dropdown field is the element that receives focus. All keyboard
  interactions happen from this element.
- Users can move the highlighted option to the next option by pressing the
  `Down arrow`.
- Users can move the highlighted option to the previous option by pressing the
  `Up arrow`.
- Users can open the dropdown menu by pressing `Space`, `Enter`, `Down arrow` or
  the `Up arrow`.
- Users can close the dropdown menu by pressing `Escape`, `Space`, or `Enter`.

#### Combo box:

- When typing a character, focus stays on the field while an option in the menu
  is highlighted that best matches the typed character.
- When typing multiple characters in rapid succession, focus stays on the field
  while an option in the menu is highlighted that best matches the string of
  characters typed.

#### Multiple selection:

- The multiselect field receives focus if none of the options are selected in
  the menu.
- Once an option in the dropdown menu receives focus, users can press `Enter` to
  select or deselect the option.
- Users can open and close a dropdown menu by pressing `Space`.

## Dropdown

Use when you can select only one option from a list at a time.

- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.
- Clicking on a closed field opens a menu of options.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-9a.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-9a-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

- Selecting an option from the menu closes it and the selected option text
  replaces the placeholder text in the field and also remains as an option in
  place if the menu is open.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-9b.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Multiselect

Use when you can select multiple options from a list or to filter information.

#### Making a selection

- By default, the dropdown displays placeholder text in the field when closed.
- Clicking a closed field opens a menu of options. Each option contains a
  checkbox input to the left of the option text.
- The menu stays open while options are being selected. The menu closes by
  clicking the field or outside of the dropdown.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default multiselect dropdown closed and open states.](images/dropdown-usage-10a.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid multiselect dropdown closed and open states.](images/dropdown-usage-10a-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of
  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The
  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.
- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.
- Unlike dropdown and combo box, the menu does not close once the user makes
  selections. Because multiple selections are possible, the user needs to click
  outside of the dropdown or on the parent element to close the menu.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default multiselect dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10b.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid multiselect dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10b-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Clear all

To clear all selected options from a list, hover over the filterable tag and
click the “x” (or `close`) icon next to the value. To help with clarity, a
browser tooltip appears when the user hovers over the “x” icon to indicate the
click action results. If you want to unselect individual options, you can do so
by unselecting the checkbox of each option.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Multiselect dropdown clear tag interaction.](images/dropdown-usage-10c.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Filtering

Use filtering to narrow down a long list of options to find the option you want
to select.

- By default, the filterable multiselect dropdown displays placeholder text in
  the field when closed.
- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default filterable dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-10d.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid filterable dropdown closed and open state.](images/dropdown-usage-10d-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to
  filter the list of options. The options that start to match your entry remain
  in the list while other existing options are temporarily removed.
- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the
  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Filterable dropdown typing and filtering open menu.](images/dropdown-usage-10e.png)

</Column>
</Row>

- Once options have been selected from the menu, a tag appears to the left of
  the text in the field containing the total number of selected options. The
  placeholder text can change to text that better reflects what is selected.
- Selected options shift to the top of the menu in alphanumeric order.
- Like the default multiselect dropdown, the menu does not close once the user
  makes selections.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default filterable dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10f.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid filterable dropdown selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-10f-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

## Combo box

Allows the the user to make a selection from a predefined list of options and is
typically used when there are a large amount of options to choose from.

- By default, the combo box displays placeholder text in the field when closed.
- When hovering over the field, a text cursor appears.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Combo box closed enabled and hover states.](images/dropdown-usage-11a.png)

</Column>
</Row>

- The menu opens by clicking anywhere in the field and you can start typing to
  sort through the list of options. The option that best matches the typed
  characters is highlighted.
- After typing text in the field, the close (x) icon appears to the right of the
  text in the field. This clears any text that’s been entered in the field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Combo box typing and option hover jumping to matched entry in the menu.](images/dropdown-usage-11b.png)

</Column>
</Row>

- Selecting an option closes the menu and the selected option replaces the
  placeholder text.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default combo box selected state.](images/dropdown-usage-11c.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

## Modifiers

#### Inline

When placing a dropdown inline with other content use the inline modifier. If
adding a visual label to an inline dropdown it should appear inline to the left
of the dropdown. If there is no visual label present you must supply an
appropriate accessibility label to the inline dropdown. _Note: Inline is only a
modifier for dropdown and does not have filtering functionality._

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

#### Dropdown versus Select

Dropdown and select components have functionality and style differences.

- The underlying code of a dropdown component is styled to match the design
  system, while the select component’s appearance is determined by the browser
  being used.
- Use a dropdown component in forms, to select multiple options at a time and to
  filter or sort content on a page. The select dropdown does not have filtering
  or multiselect functionality.
- Use a select dropdown component if most of your experience is form based.
  Custom dropdowns can be used in these situations, but the native select works
  more easily with a native form when submitting data.
- Use a select dropdown component if your experience will be frequently used on
  mobile. The native select dropdown uses the native control for the platform
  which makes it easier to use.

#### Dropdown versus Combo box

While the dropdown and combo box look similar they have different functions.

- With a dropdown list, the selected option is always visible, and the other
  options are visible by clicking and opening the list.
- A combo box is a combination of a standard list box or a dropdown list that
  lets users type inside the input field to find an option that matches their
  inputted value.
