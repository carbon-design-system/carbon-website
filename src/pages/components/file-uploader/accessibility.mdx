The file uploader React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
and violations have been identified as high priority issues. This document will
be updated when these accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. After the file uploader closes, focus should retain the user's point of
   regard and return to the element that invoked it.
2. The file uploader button can be activated using both the `Space` or `Enter`
   key.
3. The file uploader button should have text or label that accurately describes
   the action of the button.
