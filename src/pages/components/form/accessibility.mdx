## How it works

The form React Carbon component can contain any number of React Carbon
components that are used to obtain input data from a user. Validation messages
should be included to advise the user of data that is input incorrectly or a
required field that is missing information. Helper text should also be used to
provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form fields as
well as indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other
relevant information. See the individual form components for additional
information.

## Accessibility considerations

This component has been validated to meet the
[WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and
[Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) accessibility guidelines, however
changes made by the content owner can affect accessibility compliance. Be sure
to review and follow the guidance in this section when updating or adding new
content to this component.

1. Provide labels and instructions that are clear and concise.
2. Carbon Components should be used to create the form fields.
3. Provide [instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/)
   for completing the field. For example, passwords must contain at least eight
   letters and/or numbers.
4. If the number input is a required field include the
   [aria-required property](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA2.html) and
   indicate that it is a required field.
5. Although the form component passes accessibility testing, content authors
   need to ensure all content that is added to the form is accessible.

## Accessibility testing

Accessibility issues are tracked in the
[Carbon Component GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/milestones).
For screen reader test results refer to the Accessibility guidance for each
Carbon Component form control used.
