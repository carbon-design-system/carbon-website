## Structure

Forms are made up of several different components. The order in which these
elements are arranged is flexible, but should always follow the spacing
guidelines below.

Forms can be one column or two. The width of each column varies based on the
content and layout of the design. On mobile, forms can only have one column.

All icons can be found on the [icons](/guidelines/icons/library) library page.
