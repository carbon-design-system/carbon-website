## Structure

Forms are made up of several different components. The order in which these
elements are arranged is flexible and by default the vertical spacing between
elements should follow the guidelines below. The vertical spacing in a form can
be adjusted to be smaller than the default depending on the use case or layout.

Forms can be one column or two. The width of each column varies based on the
content and layout of the design. On mobile, forms can only have one column.
