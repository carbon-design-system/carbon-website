## Overview

Inline loading spinners are used when performing actions. They notify to the user that their request is being processed. Although they do not provide details about what is occurring on the back-end, they reassure the user that their action is being processed.

Use an inline loading component for any Create, Update, or Delete actions. It can be used in a table, after a primary or secondary button click, or even in a modal.

## Live demo

<ComponentDemo
  components={[
    {
      id: "inline-loading",
      label: "Inline loading",
    },
  ]}
>
  <ComponentVariant
    id="inline-loading"
    knobs={{
      InlineLoading: ["status"],
    }}
    links={{
      React:
        "http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/inlineloading--inline-loading",
      Angular:
        "https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-inline-loading--basic",
      Vue:
        "http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvinlineloading--default",
      Vanilla: "https://the-carbon-components.netlify.com/?nav=inline-loading",
    }}
  >{`
    <InlineLoading description="Loading..." />
  `}</ComponentVariant>
</ComponentDemo>

## Formatting

- If the inline loading is being used to submit a form, the form fields should get disabled.

- Descriptive text for the action is optional, but encouraged. If you have limited room or find adding text to be unnecessary you can just run through the animations.

- The _success_ state of the inline loading component is active for 1.5 seconds before calling a optional function onSuccess. Use the onSuccess function to refetch new data, close a modal, or reset a form. If no function is specified the success state will last indefinitely.

- If an error occurs, the Inline loading component should be hidden and a error notification should be added or error handling within a form should appear.

- The inline loading component should never be used to load a page or data.

## States

#### Loading

The _loading_ state indicates that the action is still in progress.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

#### Success

The _success_ state indicates that the action completed successfully.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

#### Error

The _error_ state indicates that the action did not complete successfully.
