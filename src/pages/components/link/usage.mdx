## General guidance

_Links_ are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., view more, show all). If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a [button](/components/button/code).

## Content

- Use text for links rather than graphics or icons.
- Links should be three words or less.
- Text should be consistent with the title of the intended destination.
- Use caution with links that are several words long. It is recommended that links are long enough to be understood by the user, but short enough to prevent text wrapping.
- Avoid the term “click here,” other links to “here,” or the web address itself. Instead, use a meaningful descriptive label for the link, and match the destination site name.
