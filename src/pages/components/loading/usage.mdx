## Overview

Loading spinners are used when retrieving data or performing slow computations.
They notify to the user that their request is being processed. Although they do
not provide details about what is occurring on the back-end, they reassure the
user that their action is being processed.

Use a loading spinner whenever the wait time is anticipated to be longer than
three seconds.

## Formatting

Loading spinners may be scaled down if the loading experience is contextual to a
certain item on the page.
