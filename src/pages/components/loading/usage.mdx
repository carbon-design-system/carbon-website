## Overview

The loading component provides visual feedback indicating a process or action is
in progress. It helps set users' expectations during wait times by signaling
that the system is working behind the scenes. Depending on the context, it can
be used as a full-page overlay or placed within a specific section or UI
element. Use a loading indicator if the expected wait time exceeds three
seconds.

### When to use

- Use when retrieving data or performing slow computations to indicate that a
  request is being processed.
- Use when the entire page or a key section is processing, such as after a user
  submits or saves data.

### When not to use

- Avoid using loading indicators for progressively displaying content; use
  skeleton states for a better experience.
- Do not use loading indicators if user interaction is required to proceed; use
  alternatives like [tooltips](/components/tooltip/usage),
  [progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage), or
  [notifications](/components/notification/usage) instead.
- For full-screen loads, skeleton states are preferred over indicators to create
  a smoother experience.
- Refrain from using multiple loading indicators simultaneously, as it may
  overwhelm users.

**1. Loading indicator:** A circular animated icon indicating that a process is
underway. It serves as the primary visual cue for the loading state.

### Sizing

The loading component is available in two sizes: **large** and **small**. The
large loading indicator size is the default size.

#### Large size

The large loading indicator is most commonly used to display loading in
full-screen takeover situations. It can also appear on sections within a page,
in [modals](/components/modal/usage/#loading), and on individual
[tiles](/components/tile/usage). A background overlay is typically placed behind
the large loading indicator so the user cannot interact with the elements
currently in the loading state.

#### Small size

The small loading indicator is best suited for contextual or localized loading
experiences within a specific UI element, particularly in inline loading
scenarios. It works well for quick-loading tasks and can be placed within or
near the triggering element—such as a
[button](/components/button/usage/#loading)—to indicate that a process is
underway. Common examples include saving after clicking on a button, uploading a
file, or placing the indicator beside label text to communicate the loading
status. For detailed guidance, refer to the inline loading component
[Usage](/components/inline-loading/usage/) tab.

### Placement

#### Large loading placement

The large loading indicator is commonly used for full-screen and component-level
loading scenarios. For full-screen loading, place the indicator at the center of
the viewport and apply a semi-transparent overlay to signal that the entire
interface is inactive.

<Caption>

</Caption>

When used within a component, such as a modal, tile, or side panel, center the
indicator in that space and use an overlay to prevent interaction with the
content while it is loading.

</Column>
</Row>

#### Small loading placement

The small loading indicator is ideal for inline or localized loading within
elements like buttons or compact content areas. It should appear inline with or
adjacent to the related action without using overlays. During the loading state,
any related action buttons—such as “Cancel”—should be temporarily disabled. For
more information about inline loading, refer to the inline loading component
[Usage](/components/inline-loading/usage/) tab.

## Content

### Main elements

The loading indicator can be paired with an optional label to provide additional
context during a loading state.

For large loading indicators, adding a brief status message below the indicator,
such as “Loading data…” can help set users’ expectations. The label text is not
included by default in the component but can be customized to include it if
needed.

![Example of the large loading indicator with label text](images/loading-usage-content-large.png)

<Caption>Example of the large loading indicator with label text</Caption>

For small loading indicators, especially in inline use, content should be
concise and placed near the related action. For more detailed guidance, refer to
the inline loading component’s
[Content](/components/inline-loading/usage/#content) section.

[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Behaviors

### States

The loading component has two states: **inactive** and **active**. For detailed
visual information about the various states for this component, see the
[Style](/components/loading/style/) tab.

| State    | When to use                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inactive | The inactive loading state is when no data is being loaded and has no visual indicator. |
| Active   | The active loading state indicates that the action is still in progress.                |

### Interactions

For large loading indicators, a semi-transparent overlay is applied over the
page or component, blocking all interaction. During this state, users should not
be able to interact with any elements, as the overlay indicates the interface is
temporarily unavailable.

For small loading indicators in inline loading scenarios, interactive elements
like buttons should be temporarily disabled while loading is in progress. This
prevents repeated actions and ensures a smooth user experience. For more
guidance, see the inline loading component
[Interactions](/components/inline-loading/usage/#interactions) section.
