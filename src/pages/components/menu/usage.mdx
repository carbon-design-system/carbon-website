## Overview

A menu is a disclosure component that appears with a set of actions relevant to
a specific control, interface area, data element, or application view.
Typically, this context is determined by the user's current selection prior to
invoking the menu. Menus can be opened from components such as menu buttons or
through right-clicking.

This guidance will help you understand how to format, structure, and use the
menu component effectively.

<Column colLg={8}>

### When to use

#### Declutter interface

In general, use menus to hide less frequently used or advanced options until
users specifically need them. This keeps the interface clean and focused on
essential elements.

#### Context menu

Context menus are triggered by a right-click interaction. A context menu is a
defined list of options in a menu that appears above all other content on a page
and is related to the selected content or element it was triggered from.

#### Customizable actions

Menus can speed up interactions for advanced users who are already familiar with
the application. These users often rely on shortcuts and context-specific
actions to work more efficiently.

### When not to use

#### Form submission

When submitting a form with a static list of options for users to choose from,
or when filtering, use a
[dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) instead
of a menu.

#### Complex inputs

When many or complex inputs are used collectively, use a
[popover](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage) instead
of a menu.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Menu anatomy diagram](images/usage-menu-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Trigger**: Elements that are triggered to display a list of available
   actions. These menu triggers can include a menu button, a combo button, and
   an overflow menu within menu buttons. Menus can also be opened when
   right-clicking on a page or specific element, like a column, or a row.

2. **Action item**: A menu item that can be activated to apply its action on
   certain elements. This item can be accompanied by a submenu indicator or
   keyboard shortcuts.

3. **Divider**: A rule that indicates different sections within the menu.

4. **Submenu indicator**: A caret icon that indicates a submenu.

5. **Keyboard shortcut**: Certain action items may also have keyboard shortcuts.

6. **Menu**: A container displays the open state and contains a list of actions
   that can be selected.

7. **Selected item**: An item that can be selected. The selection can be single
   or multi-selected.

8. **Submenu**: A nested level off of the primary level.

### Sizing

#### Height

Menu items come in four sizes: extra small, small, medium, and large. See more
about size specifications on the
[style](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/menu/style) tab. When
using a menu button trigger, the height of the menu item (singular) reflects the
size of the button being used.

<InlineNotification>

**Note** Currently, Carbon does not support the extra-small size for
[buttons](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/), only for
rows or menu items. Therefore, this menu size cannot be utilized with menu
button triggers. However, the extra-small menu size remains available for
implementation in other contexts if needed.

</InlineNotification>

| Size        | Height (px / rem) |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Extra small | 24 / 1.5          |
| Small       | 32 / 2            |
| Medium      | 40 / 2.5          |
| Large       | 48 / 3            |

<Column colLg={8}>

  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not mix the height of the menu buttons and the menu">

![Do not mix the height of the menu buttons and the menu](images/usage-sizing-height-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

#### Width

By default, the [menu button](/components/menu-buttons/usage/#menu-button) and
[combo button](/components/menu-buttons/usage/#combo-button) follow the
[button structure style](/components/button/style#structure), and the menu
maintains a minimum width of 160px to prevent a narrow appearance.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Menu width](images/usage-menu-width-menu-button-default.png)

<Caption>
  Menu default width when both button label and menu option labels are short
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

If the menu item labels become longer, the menu button and combo button remain
the same size, while the menu component can expand up to a maximum of 288px.
Conversely, if the button labels become longer, the menu component should not
appear narrower but should extend to match the width of the menu buttons.

If you opt for
[fluid-width default buttons](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#alignment),
both the menu button (or the combo button) and the menu should have the same
width.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do use the minimum width">

![Do use the minimum width of menu](images/usage-menu-width-do-1.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not narrow the menu to fit with other elements">

![Do not narrow the menu to fit with other elements](images/usage-menu-width-dont-1.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do match the width when the menu button or combo button label becomes longer">

![Do match the width when the menu button or combo button labels become longer](images/usage-menu-width-do-2.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not make the menu appear shorter than the menu button or combo buttons">

![Do not make the menu appear shorter than the menu button or combo button](images/usage-menu-width-dont-2.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

Ghost buttons only adhere to the
[button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/) style. This is
because enlarging the ghost button's width to match the menu's width would
result in the caret appearing disconnected from its associated button,
especially when the menu button is in its closed state.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do use default ghost button in all cases">

![Do use default ghost button in all cases](images/usage-menu-ghost-button-width-do.png)

![Do not use fluid ghost button in any cases](images/usage-menu-ghost-button-width-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Alignment

#### Default

By default, combo button, menu button, or overflow button remains positioned at
the top, to the left or right side of the menu when it is open, depending on the
available space and layout.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Menu default alignments](images/usage-menu-alignment-menu-button-default.png)

<Caption>
  Menu default width when both button label and menu item labels are short{' '}
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Alternatives

Alternatively, open menus can be positioned at the bottom, to the left or right
of its associated menu button trigger, depending on the available space and
layout.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Menu alternative alignments](images/usage-menu-alignment-menu-button-alternatives.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Action items

Ensuring consistent alignment when combining single or multi-select items with
non-select items will improve the menu's readability.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do create a consistent alignment with unselected and selected items">

![Do create a consistent alignment with unselected and selected items](images/usage-menu-alignment-item-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not create mixed alignments with unselected and selected items">

![Do not create mixed alignments with unselected and selected items](images/usage-menu-alignment-item-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

#### Right to left (RTL)

For RTL (right-to-left) languages, the entire menu is mirrored horizontally,
including the direction of the caret and keyboard shortcuts.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Menu alignment right to left](images/usage-menu-RTL.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Content

### Main elements

#### Overflow

Consider using short and precise labels for menu items. However, when deciding
to truncate long menu items, a browser rendered title tooltip will reveal the
full text on hover.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![An overflow example for menu items](images/usage-menu-overflow-truncate.png)

<Caption>Tooltip helps clarify the truncated text</Caption>
</Column>
</Row>

#### Ordering and grouping

To aid discoverability, arrange menu items in a meaningful sequence that aligns
with the order of operations. To help users focus on the most relevant options,
place the ones used most often at the top.

When there is a significant amount of menu items, it's advisable to group them
into sections, separated by divider lines.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Ordering and grouping](images/usage-menu-ordering.png)

<Caption>
  Example shows how menu items are grouped into meaningful sections
</Caption>
</Column>
</Row>

#### Number of items within a menu

Expansive lists of options in menus can overwhelm users. With context menu and
overflow menu, keep the list length manageable by including no more than 12
items to help users scan through items easily without having to scroll. With
[menu buttons](/components/menu-buttons/usage), keep the menu list smaller with
under 5 items.

<Row>
<Column colLg={4}>

![Do consider including as fewer items as possible](images/usage-menu-number-items-do.png)

<Caption>
  Do consider including as few items as possible
</Caption>
</Column>

<Column colLg={4}>

![Do not overload choices](images/usage-menu-number-items-dont.png)

<Caption>
 Do not overload choices
</Caption>
</Column>
</Row>

### Submenus

A submenu is a menu item with the caret icon on the right, offering additional
related commands. While submenus can help tidy up a context menu and make its
options clearer, introducing multiple levels of submenus can make the user
experience more complex and harder to navigate. Avoid multiple levels of nesting
when it comes to submenus.

#### Actions associated with a shared label

When a term appears in more than two menu items in the same group, consider
eliminating the recurring term in the submenu label to help people predict its
content and scan easily.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do omit recurring term">

![Do omit recurring term](images/usage-image-submenus-title-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not repeat the same term from the submenu trigger">

![Do not repeat the same term from the submenu trigger](images/usage-image-submenus-title-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Behaviors

### States

Menu items have seven states: **enabled**, **hover**, **focus**, **focus** and
**hover**, **danger hover**, **danger hover and focus**, and **disabled**. Learn
more about states on the [style](/components/menu/style/) tab.

| State                    | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Enabled_                | When an action in the list is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component.                                                                                          |
| _Hover_                  | When a user’s mouse cursor is hovering over the menu item in menus or submenus.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| _Focus_                  | When a user tabs to or clicks on a menu trigger. This will open up the menu list. The first item in the menu list has the focus state as default.                                                                                                         |
| _Focus and hover_        | When an item is in the focus state but the user’s mouse cursor is hovering over the item row.                                                                                                                                                             |
| _Danger hover_           | When an action could have destructive effects on the user’s data (for example, delete or remove).                                                                                                                                                         |
| _Danger hover and focus_ | When a user tabs to a destructive menu item that has the danger hover state.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Disabled_               | When an action is not able to be performed at a certain time, but will be possible to be performed by that user, at another point in time. Actions that are permissions-based should be hidden if it is never possible for a user to perform that action. |

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Once the menu opens by clicking on a menu button trigger or right-clicking on an
area, users can:

- Select or deselect an item by clicking on it
- Hover over the item with the caret icon to reveal additional options or
  actions from that item
- Click outside of the menu area to close it

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Mouse interactions on menus](images/usage-interactions-mouse.png)

<Caption>Mouse interactions on menu</Caption>
</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

Once the menu opens by pressing `Return` or `Enter` on the menu trigger, users
can:

- Press `Up` and `Down` arrows to navigate between menu options
- Press `Return` or `Enter` or `Right` arrow on the item with the caret icon to
  reveal additional options
- Press `Return` or `Enter` on an item to select or deselect it
- Press `Escape` to close it

### Responsive behaviors

Once the menu opens, the first option is highlighted. Users can then move
through the list of options to activate or select one item at a time. Once users
activate or select a menu item, the menu closes.

Activating a menu item can trigger the following:

- Open a dialog box
- Set a value (which can perform an action or serve as a selected/deselected
  option in the menu)
- Open a new page (typically in a new window or tab)
- Initiate a new user task (potentially involving multiple steps)
- Save or close something
- Expand a submenu (though this can also occur without activation)
- Undo or redo a user action
- Perform various actions (e.g., editing actions like cut, paste, copy, format;
  application actions such as checking for updates)
- Open a sidebar or toolbar
- Access an existing page
- Adjust the current window(s) (e.g., minimize, split, arrange, swap)
- No action other than closing the menu

## Modifiers

#### Dividers

Divider lines serve the purpose of categorizing related actions into appropriate
sections, while also distinguishing actions that might have a significant impact
on the user's data, such as deleting an app or service.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Divider in menus](images/usage-menu-divider.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard shortcuts

A menu item can display related values, like a caret indicator for accessing a
submenu or a keyboard shortcut linked to the action.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Divider in menus](images/usage-menu-shortcut.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Single-select and multi-select

Single-select or multi-select has the same visual with the checkmark in front of
the menu item.

<Row>
<Column colLg={4}>

![Single-select example](images/usage-menu-single-select.png)

</Column>

<Column colLg={4}>

![Multi-select example](images/usage-menu-multi-select.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Danger state

A danger hover state can be applied to actions that could cause significant
changes, such as delete.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Danger state example](images/usage-menu-danger-state.png)

</Column>
</Row>
