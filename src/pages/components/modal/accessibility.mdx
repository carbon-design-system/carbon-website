Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard modal dialog component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

Modal dialogs take focus on appearance, and the tab order is constrained to the modal’s controls until the modal is closed by choosing one of the buttons with `Enter` or `Space`, or is dismissed by pressing `Esc`.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Links are reached by Tab key and activated by Space and Enter keys.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Contrast

Carbon’s modal dialog text color meets the minimum contrast requirement of 4.5:1 with
its background. Carbon also uses a modal dialog color that contrast 3:1 against body
text, so that modal dialog text is distinguishable even without an underline.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  modal dialog text has sufficient contrast with both its background and surrounding
  body text.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Design recommendations

### Ensure modal dialog context

If your design uses generic modal dialog names such as “read more,” consider making them
unique. Otherwise, annotate a connection with other text in the design that
provides context. This will allow developers to implement in a way that
increases accessibility. See the Equal Access Toolkit
[modal dialog text topic](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/#modal-text).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Annotate the connection between generic links and text that gives context.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Associate generic links such as “read more” with other contextual text, using
  either `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby` (to concatenate multiple text
  strings). See the
  [Equal Access Toolkit guidance](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/text-and-non-text/#aria-labelling)
  for more details.
- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#link)
  for more considerations.
