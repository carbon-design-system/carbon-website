## Overview

Modals are a variant of [dialog](/patterns/dialog-pattern) used to present
critical information or request user input needed to complete a user’s workflow.
Modals interrupt a user’s workflow by design. When active, a user is blocked
from the on-page content and cannot return to their previous workflow until the
modal task is completed or the user dismisses the modal. While effective when
used correctly, modals should be used sparingly to limit disruption to the user.

Modal dialogs are commonly used for short and non-frequent tasks, such as
editing or management tasks. If a user needs to repeatably preform a task,
consider making the task do-able from the main page.

### When to use

#### Require an immediate response from the user

Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from
continuing a user-initiated process.

#### Notify the user of urgent information

Use a modal dialog to notify the user of urgent information concerning their
current work. Modal dialogs are commonly used to report system errors or convey
a consequence of a user’s action.

#### Confirm a user decision

Use a modal dialog to confirm user decisions. Clearly describe the action being
confirmed and explain any potential consequences that it may cause. Both the
title and the button should reflect the action that will occur. If the action is
destructive or irreversible then use a transactional danger modal.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Modal anatomy diagram](images/modal-usage-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

The modal is composed of three distinct zones: A header, the body, and a footer.
Components (eg. data table, form, progress indicator) can occupy the full width
of the modal.

1. **Header**: Includes a title, optional label, and the close icon.

2. **Body**: Contains the information and/or controls needed to complete the
   modal's task. It can include message text and components.

3. **Footer**: Contains the main actions needed to complete or cancel the dialog
   task. Button groupings change based on modal variant.

4. **x**: The close `x` icon will close the dialog without submitting any data.

5. **Overlay**: Screen overlay that obscures the on-page content.

### Sizing

There are four responsive [modal sizes](/components/modal/style#sizes): **xs,
small, default, large**. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal
content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to
avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or
large modal will be more accommodating.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Modal sizes](images/modal-usage-sizes.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Max heights

Each modal size has a [max height](/components/modal/style#max-sizes) in order
to maintain a proper window ratio. If your modal has too much scrolling due to a
max height consider using the next modal size up. If the large modal height is
still not enough space then this is an indicator that a full page may be needed
instead.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Modal max heights](images/modal-usage-max-heights.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Alignment

Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20%
[margin-right](/components/modal/style#margin-right). However, form inputs and
other components expand the full width of a modal window.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Modal alignment](images/modal-usage-alignment.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Content

### Main elements

#### Title

- The title should be brief, using a verb plus noun combination that clearly
  describes the dialog’s task or purpose.
- You can use an optional label above the title to set the context for the
  information in the dialog.

#### Body copy

- A modal should include only content relevant to completing the current task.
- Text should only be 80% of the modal’s width and components can span 100% of
  the width.

#### Footer

- Use descriptive words for the actions such as Add, Delete, and Save. Avoid
  vague words like Done or OK. For a list of approved action labels, see
  Carbon's
  [content guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/action-labels).
- If you need to include a “docs” or other non-primary action, include it as a
  link in the modal’s body.

### Overflow content

When the modal content is longer than the modal height then the body section
should scroll vertically with the header and footer remaining fixed in place.
The content should visibly fade at the end of the modal body area to indicate
there is additional content out of view.

Modal content should never scroll horizontally; instead, use a larger size
modal.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Overflow content example](images/modal-usage-scrolling.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Title as message

For short, direct messages the title can include the whole message to add visual
clarity to an otherwise repetitive title and body message. When using this
style, no other body copy may be included.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Title as message example](images/modal-usage-title.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Behaviors

### Trigger

Modals are triggered as a result of a user’s action and are not system
generated. Common components that can trigger a modal include, button, link, or
icon. On a keyboard, selecting `Enter` or `Space` should launch the modal.

### Focus

Once the modal is open, set the initial focus to the first location that accepts
user input. For example, if the modal contains a form then the focus should
automatically be set to the first field when opened. If it is a transactional
modal without form inputs in the body section then the first focus should be on
the primary button.

Focus should then remain trapped in the dialog until it is closed. When
navigating by keyboard, `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` do not move the focus outside of
the modal.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Modal focus example](images/modal-usage-focus.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Loading

The task completion action should take place immediately. If a longer loading
period is needed then a [loading spinner](/components/loading/usage) and overlay
should appear on top of the modal body area with content disabled. The primary
action button should be disabled while loading is in progress.

If a quick loading period is needed then use a
[inline loading](/patterns/loading-pattern#inline-loading) behavior on the
primary button to indicate the data is being processed.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Modal loading options](images/modal-usage-loading.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Validation

Validate a user’s entries before the modal is closed. If any entry is invalid
then the modal should remain open with the entry marked in an error state and
include an inline error message. The message should inform the user what has
happened and provide guidance on next steps or possible resolutions. Effective
and immediate error messaging can help the user to understand the problem and
how to fix it.

When possible, we recommend validating the user’s data before submission. This
kind of inline validation (aka client-side validation) should happen as soon as
the field loses focus. This will help easily identify the elements that need to
be corrected. On field error messages should disappear when the form criteria is
met. If the data was not able to be submitted due to server-side issues then an
inline notification should appear.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Validation example](images/modal-usage-invalid.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Modal variants

### Passive modal

Passive modals presents information the user needs to be aware of concerning
their current workflow. It contains no actions for the user to take and should
not include any data that needs to be submitted. They serve as a type of
notification alerting the user to urgent information such as reporting system
errors or conveying a consequence of a user's action.

#### Dismissing a passive modal

Passive modals are persistent until dismissed in one of the following ways.

- **x**: Clicking the close `x` icon in the upper right will close the modal
  without submitting any data and return the user to its previous context.
- **Click elsewhere**: Clicking outside the passive modal area will
  automatically close the modal.
- **Esc**: Press `ESC` on the keyboard

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Passive modal example](images/modal-usage-passive.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Transactional modal

Transactional modals are used to validate user decisions or to gain secondary
confirmation from the user. Transactional modals require an action to be taken
in order for the modal to be completed and closed. It contains a cancel and
primary action buttons.

#### Dismissing a transactional modal

Transactional modals are persistent until dismissed in one of the following
ways.

- **Task completion**: clicking the primary action will complete the task and
  automatically close the modal.
- **Cancel button**: clicking the cancel button will close the modal and return
  the user to its previous context. Cancel undoes all applied changes.
- **x**: Clicking the close `x` icon in the upper right will close the modal
  without submitting any data and return the user to its previous context.
- **Esc**: Press `ESC` on the keyboard.

#### Two buttons

When using two buttons, the secondary button is on the left and the primary
button is placed on the right. Each button spans 50% of the dialog and are full
bleed to the edge.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Two button modal example](images/modal-usage-two-buttons.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Three buttons

In the rare case where three buttons are needed, each is 25% of the dialog width
and aligned to the right side of the modal. Only the outmost right button is
allowed to be a primary button with the other two being secondary buttons. If
all three actions have the same weight then all three should be secondary
buttons.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Three button modal example](images/modal-usage-three-buttons.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Danger modal

Danger modal is a specific kind of
[transactional modal](/components/modal/usage#transactional-modal) used for
destructive or irreversible actions. In danger modal, the primary button is
replaced by a danger button. They are commonly used in high impact moments as a
confirmation for an action that would result in a significant data loss if done
accidentally.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![danger modal](images/modal-usage-danger.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Acknowledgment modal

Acknowledgment modals are used when the system requires the user to acknowledge
the presented information. It contains only a single button, commonly “OK”. 
Acknowledgment is confirmed when the user clicks the primary button.

#### Dismissing an acknowledgment modal

Acknowledgment modals are persistent until dismissed in one of the following
ways.

- **Task completion**: Clicking the primary action will complete the task and
  automatically close the modal.
- **x**: Clicking the close `x` icon in the upper right will close the modal
  without submitting the user's acknowledgement and return the user to the
  previous context.
- **Esc**: Press `ESC` on the keyboard.

#### Single button

Single buttons are placed on the right side, span 50% of the modal, and bleed to
the edge. In most scenarios, a primary button is used when one button is needed.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![One button modal example](images/modal-usage-one-button.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Progress modal

For longer tasks, use a progress modal to give the user a sense of completion
and orientation within the focused flow. For complex flows with complex choices,
consider using a full page instead of a modal. A progress modal is not a
solution for excess modal content. It should only be used to present information
in more consumable and focused chunks.

#### Dismissing a progress modal

Transactional modals are persistent until dismissed in one of the following
ways.

- **Task completion**: Clicking the primary action will complete the task and
  automatically close the modal.
- **Cancel button**: Clicking the Cancel button will close the modal and return
  the user to its previous context. Cancel undoes all applied changes.
- **x**: Clicking the close `x` icon in the upper right will close the modal
  without submitting any data and return the user to its previous context.
- **Esc**: Press `ESC` on the keyboard.

#### Button group

There are three buttons in the progress modal footer: Cancel, Previous, Next.
Each button’s width is 25% of the dialog window and are full bleed. Previous and
Next are grouped together and placed on the right half of the dialog, with
Previous as a secondary button and Next as a primary button. In the last step of
the sequence, the Next button label should change to reflect the final action.
The Cancel button is aligned to left side of the dialog and uses a ghost button.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Progress modal example](images/modal-usage-progress.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Related

#### Modal vs. notification

Modals are highly disruptive and block tasks until dismissed by the user. A
modal should only be used as a form of notification if it provides the user with
critical information immediately related to their task. For non-critical
messaging, consider using a toast or inline notification instead of a modal.
Toast and inline notifications provide users with non-disruptive feedback or the
status of an action without breaking their workflow.
