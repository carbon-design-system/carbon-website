No accessibility annotations are needed for notifications, but keep these
considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom
component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

Users can navigate through the interactive elements within the notification
using the `Tab` key. Actions such as closing or activating buttons can be
performed using the `Enter` or `Space` keys. Additionally, some notifications
can optionally be closed by pressing the `Escape` key.

#### Inline and toast

Inline and toast notifications do not contain interactive elements, and they do
not receive focus.

#### Actionable

Actionable notifications may contain interactive elements such as links and
buttons. This component grabs and traps focus until an action is taken or the
notification is dismissed. Users can navigate through the interactive elements
using the `Tab` key, and actions like closing or activating buttons can be
performed using the `Enter` or `Space` keys. Additionally, the notification can
be optionally closed by pressing the `Escape` key.

#### Callout

A callout can include interactive elements such as links, which users can
navigate through using the `Tab` key. Actions on these links can be performed
using the `Enter` or `Space` keys.

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Use the roles `alert`, `log`, or `status` for notifications that do not
  require user action.
- Use the role `alertdialog` for notifications that require user action.
- Callouts do not have an aria-live attribute, and are not automatically
  announced by screen readers.

Special care should be given to focus management for notifications with
interactive elements or actions. It is not recommended to venture beyond using
the roles `alert`, `log`, `status`, or `alertdialog` for event-driven
notifications, as this can present unique challenges. If you choose to do so,
there are two known approaches you may want to research further:

- Collect notifications in a persistent area in your application for users to be
  able to navigate to and take action on notifications.
- Render notifications in an already-existing `region` that can be accessed via
  a hotkey. Focus should jump to the notification region after the hotkey is
  invoked. Once the user has reached the end of the region, focus should return
  to the previously focused item in the document before the hotkey was invoked.

Neither approach is perfect, but in either case, ensure that notifications are
properly announced, respect user timeout preferences, and are easily navigable
by keyboard or screen reader for users to take action.
