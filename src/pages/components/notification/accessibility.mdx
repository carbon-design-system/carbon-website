## How it works

Notification Carbon components are messages that communicate information to a
user. The WAI-ARIA `role="status"` and `role="log"` are equivalent to
`aria-live="polite"`. It is used to display a message to the user in a way that
does not interrupt the user's current task and queues the notification until
whatever task the user is currently working on is complete. If the notification
contains an urgent message, a `role="alert"` can be used, it is equivalent to
`aria-live="assertive"`. It is used to display a message to the user that
interrupts the user's current task. These are considerably more disruptive to
users than the`role="status"`or`role="log"`. In either case, these notifications
attract the userâ€™s attention without receiving focus to communicate the message.

Details pertaining to these roles include specifics around containing
interactive elements, focus behavior, close behavior, and semantic contents. The
`role` of `status`, `log`, and `alert` can not contain interactive elements,
should not be given focus, and can optionally be closed by pressing the `Escape`
key. The close button is given `aria-hidden="true"` so it is ignored by
assistive technologies. Generally, plain text is preferred to be used within
these notifications. When read by screenreaders, any semantic meaning
surrounding the contents is not reflected to the user. For instace - Bold or
italic emphasis, and/or semantic elements such as `<li>` etc. are not read to
the user. If semantics are included, it should be non-essential to the
understanding or meaning of the contents.

Notification components are allowed interactive children (actions) though, and
when an interactive element is provided, a `role="alertdialog"` is used. These
notifications should immediately be given focus so the user can navigate through
the interactive elements. The close button is given an ARIA label of
`aria-label="close"`, and the icon has `aria-hidden="true"` so it is ignored by
assistive technologies. The `Tab` key is used to move focus to the action and
close button within the notification and the `Space` key or `Enter` key activate
the appropriate button within the notification. It can also be optionally closed
via pressing the `Escape` key.

## Accessibility considerations

1. Avoid using a toast notification for critical alerts or long messages because
   they are timed and will disappear automatically making it difficult for
   people with various disabilities to get the entire message. An alert that
   disappears too quickly can lead to failure of the optional
   [WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3 (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-no-exceptions.html).
2. Provide a means to turn off nonessential alerts to enhance usability for
   people with visual and cognitive disabilities. Additional information is
   available in
   [WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.4 (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html).
   Note: Providing this functionality is optional.

3. Ensure the use of color and hidden icons are not used as the only means of
   conveying the importance of the notification.
