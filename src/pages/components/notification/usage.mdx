## Overview

### When to use

Use notifications to inform users of updates or changes to system status.
Communicating with users and providing immediate feedback are important for
building trust. While notifications are an effective method of communicating
with users, they are disruptive and should be used sparingly.

For more context on when to use each notification variant, including modals,
refer to the [notifications pattern](/patterns/notification-pattern/). Carbon
only supports inline, toast, and modal notification variants, although some
product teams also support banners and notification centers.

### Variants

| Variant                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Inline](#inline-notifications) | Inline notifications show up in task flows, to notify users of the status of an action. They usually appear at the top of the primary content area.              |
| [Toast](#toast-notifications)   | Toasts are non-modal, time-based window elements used to display short messages; they usually appear at the top of the screen and disappear after a few seconds. |

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![notification anatomy image](images/01_notification_anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Icon:** Informs users of the kind of notification at a glance.
2. **Title:** Gives users a quick overview of the notification.
3. **Message (optional):** Provides additional detail and actionable steps for
   the user to take.
4. **Inline notification action (optional):** Ghost button that allows users to
   address the notification or navigates them to a page with further details.
5. **Close button (optional):** Closes the notification.
6. **Time stamp (optional):** Shows the time the toast notification was sent.

## Content

Notifications provide limited space for content, and therefore the content must
be short and concise. A user should be able to quickly scan the notification, be
apprised of the situation, and know what to do next.

### Main elements

#### Title

- The title should be short and descriptive, explaining the most important piece
  of information.
- When possible, communicate the main message using just the title.
- Use a period only if the title is a full sentence.

#### Body content

- Be concise and avoid repeating or paraphrasing the title.
- Limit content to one or two short sentences.
- Explain how to resolve the issue by including any troubleshooting actions or
  next steps. You can include links within the notification body that redirect
  the user to next steps.

#### Action

- Keep labels concise and clearly indicate the action the user can take.
- Limit action labels to one or two words. For a list of recommended action
  labels, see Carbon's
  [content guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/action-labels).

### Overflow

If a toast or inline notification requires a message longer than two lines,
include a short message with a “View more” link that takes the user to a view of
the full notification message. This can be either a full page with more details
or a modal.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Inline notifications

### Formatting

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of inline notification with action button](images/02_notification_format_608.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Action

Inline notifications have an optional ghost button action that is adjacent to
the title and body content. On mobile screens the action button wraps under the
body content. This button should allow users to take further action on the
notification.

#### Sizing

The width of inline notifications varies based on content and layout. They can
expand to the fill the container or content area they relate to. Their height is
based on the content length, which should not exceed two lines of text.

#### Placement

Inline notifications appear near their related items. They can expand to fill
the width of the container or content area they are in and should align to the
grid columns.

We recommend placing inline notifications at the bottom of forms, just above the
submission and cancel buttons. When error notifications apply to individual text
inputs, they should supplement the error state on that specific input field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of inline notification placement](images/03_notification_placement_inline_608.png)

<Caption>

</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Behavior

#### Dismissal

Inline notifications do not dismiss automatically. They persist on the page
until the user dismisses them or takes action that resolves the notification.

A small "x" in the top right corner is used to dismiss inline notifications.
Including the close button is optional and should not be included if it is
critical for a user to read or interact with the notification.

## Toast notifications

### Formatting

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of toast notification with action button and time stamp](images/04_toast_format_608.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Action

Carbon toast notifications are not fully accessible when they include
interactive content. Using links and other interactive content in toasts breaks
WCAG 2.1 compliance and should therefore be avoided. The Carbon team is aware of
the accessibility concerns and is currently working on deprecating this
functionality.

#### Time stamp

Toast notifications include a time stamp at the bottom the container. The time
stamp shows the time the notification was sent. Using time stamps is optional
but toasts should be consistent across the product so either all toasts should
include time stamps or none of them should. The time stamp is optional and can
be removed if a third line of content is needed.

#### Sizing

Toast notifications use a fixed width and their height depends on the length of
the notification message. As noted in the content guidelines, limit toast
notifications to two lines of text.

#### Placement

Toast notifications slide in and out from the top right of the screen. They
stack with `$spacing-03` in-between. New toast notifications should appear at
the top of the list, with older notifications being pushed down until they are
dismissed.

Actionable toast notifications do not appear on mobile screen widths.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of toast notification placement](images/05_toast_context_608.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Behavior

#### Dismissal

Toasts dismiss automatically after five seconds on the screen. They can also
include a close button so users can dismiss them sooner. Toasts cover content on
the screen so they should always be easily dismissed. Because toast
notifications dismiss automatically, users must be able to access them elsewhere
after the toast disappears. This allows them to be accessible for users who need
more time reading the notification or who may want to refer back to the
notification.

## Modifiers

### High and low contrast

Carbon supports high and low contrast style notifications. High-contrast
notifications are best for critical messaging while low-contrast notifications
are less visually disruptive for users.

It's up to the product team to decide which notification style to use in their
product. Inline and toast notifications can use different styles but you should
never mix styles within each notification variant. When in doubt, use
low-contrast notifications.

<Column colLg={8}>
