Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Their
systematic reuse helps to create visual and functional consistency across
products.

## Accessibility tag status

Automated accessibility verification tests are ran for each change proposed to
the Carbon codebase. Additional manual tests are done periodically, such as
screenreader testing. These tests ensure a consistent baseline of accessibility
for each stable component.

These accessibility tests can differ in their level of depth, breadth, and
fidelity. A series of tags surface these differences throughout the website. The
tags represent different levels of code test fidelity across individual
components and types of testing within the system.

| Tag                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag>          | Tests have been implemented, pass, and show no violations via the [IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access) for a components' default state, advanced states, and keyboard navigation.                                                                 |
| <Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> | Some testing has been done, but is still incomplete and in progress. For example, manual tests may not have covered all use cases, or automated tests may not cover all component states. Previously existing tests may have become invalid and are temporarily skipped or removed.         |
| <Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag>  | Manual testing has been performed and validated by a human to ensure proper accessibility, such as screen reader testing.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <Tag>Not available</Tag>                | In some cases, testing data is not available for certain components or component states. For instance, keyboard navigation testing is not necessary for components that are non-interactive.                                                                                                |
| <Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag> | Manual and/or automated testing has been deferred. Most often this applies to experimental or unstable components that do not have testing performed until they are [moved to stable](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/experimental-code.md#moving-to-stable). |

## Accessibility test categories

Every accessibility test falls into one of four categories. Marked with the tags above, these categories show the status for each of these discrete areas of testing. This additional detail helps clarify exactly what ways a component has been tested for accessibility.

| Test                | Meaning                                                                                                                               | Possible Tags                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default state       | The default state of the component                                                                                                    | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Advanced states     | Tests that ensure additional states of the component are accessible. This could be interactive states of a component or its multiple variants. | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Keyboard navigation | This test ensures every action a mouse user can do should have a keyboard equivalent.                                                 | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                                     |
| Screen reader       | This test ensures that the visual information on the screen is reinforced programmatically.                                           | <Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> |
