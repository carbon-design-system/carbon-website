Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Their
systematic reuse helps to create visual and functional consistency across
products.

## Accessibility tag status

For every latest release, Carbon runs tests on all components to meet the
accessibility requirements. These different statuses report the work that Carbon
has done in the back end. These tests appear only when the components are
stable.

| Tag                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag>          | When all tests pass and there are no violations when running the automated [Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) on default state, advanced states, and keyboard navigation.              |
| <Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> | When some tests pass or are removed, they are either combined into existing tests or substituted with new ones and moved to a different file. Skipped tests stay in the file but are clearly marked with test.skip. |
| <Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag>  | When screen reader tests are conducted manually and validated by a human to ensure quality.                                                                                                                         |
| <Tag>Not available</Tag>                | Usually, with keyboard navigation tests or screen reader, when this type of test is not available for certain components.                                                                                           |
| <Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag> | Usually, with experimental or unstable components, tests have not been conducted for either automated or manual testing.                                                                                            |

## Accessibility tests

Accessibility AVT (Accessibility Automated Verification Testing) involves the
use of automated tools and software to assess the accessibility of a digital
product against established accessibility standards, such as the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

| Test                | Meaning                                                                                                                               | Possible Tags                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default state       | The default state of the component                                                                                                    | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Advanced states     | Other states rather than the default state of a component. These could be interactive states of a component or its multiple variants. | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Keyboard navigation | This test ensures every action a mouse user can do should have a keyboard equivalent.                                                 | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                                     |
| Screen reader       | This test ensures that the visual information on the screen is reinforced programmatically.                                           | <Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> |
