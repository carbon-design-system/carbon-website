Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Their
systematic reuse helps to create visual and functional consistency across
products.

## Accessibility tag status

Automated accessibility verification tests are ran for each change proposed to
the Carbon codebase. Additional manual tests are done periodically, such as
screenreader testing. These tests ensure a consistent baseline of accessibility
for each stable component.

These accessibility tests can differ in their level of depth, breadth, and
fidelity. A series of tags surface these differences throughout the website. The
tags represent different levels of code test fidelity across individual
components and types of testing within the system.

| Tag                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag>          | Tests have been implemented, pass, and show no violations via the [IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker](https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access) for a components' default state, advanced states, and keyboard navigation. |
| <Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> | When some tests pass or are removed, they are either combined into existing tests or substituted with new ones and moved to a different file. Skipped tests stay in the file but are clearly marked with test.skip.         |
| <Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag>  | When screen reader tests are conducted manually and validated by a human to ensure quality.                                                                                                                                 |
| <Tag>Not available</Tag>                | Usually, with keyboard navigation tests or screen reader, when this type of test is not available for certain components.                                                                                                   |
| <Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag> | Usually, with experimental or unstable components, tests have not been conducted for either automated or manual testing.                                                                                                    |

## Accessibility tests

Accessibility AVT (Accessibility Automated Verification Testing) involves the
use of automated tools and software to assess the accessibility of a digital
product against established accessibility standards, such as the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

| Test                | Meaning                                                                                                                               | Possible Tags                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default state       | The default state of the component                                                                                                    | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Advanced states     | Other states rather than the default state of a component. These could be interactive states of a component or its multiple variants. | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                      |
| Keyboard navigation | This test ensures every action a mouse user can do should have a keyboard equivalent.                                                 | <Tag type="green">Tested</Tag><br/><Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag>                                                     |
| Screen reader       | This test ensures that the visual information on the screen is reinforced programmatically.                                           | <Tag>Not available</Tag><br/><Tag type="purple">Not yet tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="teal">Manually tested</Tag><br/><Tag type="blue">Partially tested</Tag> |
