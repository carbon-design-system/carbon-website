Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Their
systematic reuse helps to create visual and functional consistency across
products.

## Components

Each component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such
as presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing
feedback to the user, and so on. All of the components in Carbon have been
designed to work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole.

Additional components, maintained by the Carbon community, are available in
[Community assets](/community/component-index).
