## Building blocks

Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Each
component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such as
presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing feedback
to the user, and so on. All of the components in Carbon have been designed to
work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole.
