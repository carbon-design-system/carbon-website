No accessibility annotations are needed for pagination, but keep these
considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom
component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

#### Pagination

The tab order goes from left to right through the controls in the pagination
variant. On focus, the dropdowns are opened with `Space` or with up or down
arrows, which also cycle through the values. Both `Space` and `Enter` select a
value and close the dropdown. The dropdown can also be closed by pressing `Esc`.
The previous and next page arrow buttons are activated by `Space` or `Enter`
keys.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

  behaviors and tab order.

</Column>
</Row>

When the pagination is at either end of its range, one of the page navigation
buttons becomes invalid. When that happens, the button is no longer navigable or
operable, like any other disabled control.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

  the start of its range.

</Column>
</Row>

#### Pagination nav

The tab order goes left to right through the button controls in the pagination
nav variant. When page buttons have focus, both `Space` and `Enter` activates
the page button and change the current page to the button that currently has
selection. When the previous and next page arrow buttons have focus, both
`Space` and `Enter` activates them.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

If an overflow ellipsis is present in the pagination nav, once focused, pressing
Space activates the menu to choose an available page to navigate to. Enter or
Tab selects a value from the menu and closes it. The menu can also be closed by
pressing Esc.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Labeling

#### Pagination

Not all the elements in pagination have static or visually isolated labels.
Carbon constructs a programmatic name for the second dropdown by concatenating
dynamically generated text on the screen. Carbon also provides accessible names
for the icon-only buttons.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![illustration showing labels for dropdown and icon-only buttons](images/pagination-a11y-5.png)

<Caption>
  Carbon provides the accessible names "page number, of 40 pages", "previous",
  and "next" for assistive technology.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Pagination nav

Carbon constructs a programmatic name for the page ghost buttons by
concatenating dynamically generated text on the screen. Carbon also provides
accessible names for the icon-only buttons.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Carbon provides the accessible names "page", "previous", and "next" for assistive technology.](images/pagination-a11y-6.png)

<Caption>
  Carbon provides the accessible names "page", "previous", and "next" for
  assistive technology.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Carbon uses `<select>` elements for the dropdowns.
- Consult the
  [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/combobox/combobox-select-only.html)
  for more considerations.
