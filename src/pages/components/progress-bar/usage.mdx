## Overview

A progress bar indicates that the user's request has been received and the
application is making progress toward completing the requested action. Progress
bars inform users about the status of ongoing processes, the estimated time of
how long a process will take, or if a request is being executed.

<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### When to use

- For a long operation or a process that can take a considerable or unknown
  amount of time
- When the process can be described with quantitative information, such as a
  percentage
- To visually show the progression of a system operation such as downloading,
  uploading, loading data, submitting a form, or saving updates
- To convey that data is being requested, transferred or processed

#### When not to use

- When the progress bar will be replaced by a minor user interface element once
  loaded, use [skeleton states](/patterns/loading) instead
- When manual user actions are required to progress, use a
  [progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator/usage) instead
- When the progress is determined by user actions such as tutorials completed,
  or storage space, rather than system actions
- If the process takes less than 5 seconds to load, use
  [loading spinners](/components/loading/usage) instead

#### Inline loading or progress bar?

If an activity displays a loading spinner on one screen, it should not show the
progress bar elsewhere in the design.

## Live demo

## Variants

A progress bar can either be determinate or indeterminate. The determinate
variant is visualized as a track on which a bar fills up from left to right
representing the progress. The indeterminate variant is visualized as a track on
which a bar is moving along in constant speed, repeating over time.

| Variant                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| [Determinate](Determinate)     | Use determinate progress bars for a specified amount of time or clear information about the progression — they convey exact and qualitative information about the progression.                                                                             |     |
| [Indeterminate](Indeterminate) | Use indeterminate progress bars for an unspecified completion of time or unclear information about the progression — they convey that users’ request, action, or data is being processed at the moment without indicating how long the activity will take. |

## Determinate progress bar

Determinate progress bars are used when the loading progress can be tracked and
translated into a percentage indicator which fills from 0% to 100% and never
decreases in value. The entire animation moves from the left to the right — with
no back and forth motion.

Use a determinate progress bar when the progress can be calculated against a
specific goal. For example, when downloading a file of a known size.

## Indeterminate progress bar

Indeterminate progress bars are used when the loading progress is unknown or the
amount of wait time can't be calculated.

Once triggered, the loading bar will begin by moving along in constant speed,
repeating over time while data is being gathered during the first stages of the
load. This bar then changes to a determinate indicator (finishing from left to
right) when enough information is gathered to end the load animation. The final
determinate stage of the load is used to visually indicate the completion of the
task to the user. In this scenario, a percentage indicator would not be present.

### Progress status

It's best to give the user transparency about the process which usually leads to
increased trust in the software or platform. However, it may not be possible to
provide progress estimation in certain cases. If progress data is not available,
an indeterminate progress bar can be used.

As a more concrete set of examples, there are generally three different major
progressions of a system operation: downloading, uploading, and local
processing.

#### Downloading

For downloading actions, it's usually possible to get a value of progress and
update it in real time for a determinate progress bar. Depending on the
information reported from a data source, time remaining could be estimated based
on how much has been downloaded so far over a time period.

#### Uploading

Upload actions may be unable to report real time progress status depending on
the data source and API configuration. However, always strive to provide users
the determinate value whenever it's possible to inform them about the process.

#### Data processing

Data processing refers to manipulations of data to produce meaningful
information. This can include currency exchange, file generation, data
reformatting, or similar operations. Depending on the operation, time estimated
or cycles to complete processing could be used to populate a determinate
progress bar.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Progress bar anatomy](images/progress-bar-usage-6.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Label:** The text describes the process that the progress bar refers to.
   The label can be visually hidden, but must be defined in order to be
   accessible.
2. **Track:** The static area that the bar indicator moves on top of and acts as
   a fixed visual reference of what the total length and duration of the process
   could be.
3. **Bar indicator:** Indicates how much the process has progressed.
4. **Helper text (optional):** Assistive text to show additional information
   about the process taking place. For determinate, the information is usually
   values of number or percentage. Sometimes, a fraction or ratio may be shown.
   These values are not applicable when a progress bar is indeterminate.

### Sizing

#### Height

The progress bar is offered in two different sizes—big (8px) and small (4px).
The big progress bar height is typically used when there is large amounts of
space on a page. The small progress bar height is commonly used when space is
restricted and can be placed within cards, data tables, or side panels.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Progress bar sizes](images/progress-bar-usage-7.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Width

The width of a progress bar can be customized appropriately for its context. The
minimum width of a progress bar is 48px and keep its width to a maximum of six
columns when possible. If the progress bar width is too long it can reduce
readability. Don't increase the progress bar length to fill the entire width of
a window or application.

<DoDontRow>

  <DoDont caption="Do keep a width within six columns.">

![Do keep a width within six columns.](images/progress-bar-usage-8.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not exceed a width of six columns.">

![Do not exceed a width of six columns.](images/progress-bar-usage-9.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Alignment

Text alignment depends on the context and area given. As long as the text is
placed close to the progress bar, it’s up to designers to provide the best
judgement that fits the context.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Progress bar alignments](images/progress-bar-usage-10.png)

<Caption>A few common examples of text alignment for progress bars</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Text placement

Labels or helper text should always be placed above, below, or beside the
progress bar for readability. Avoid placing text inside or centering text with
the progress bar. This visual could cause clutter and inconsistency in text
alignment. Meanwhile, placing the text far away from the progress bar could
cause confusion in the context.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do place text close to the progress bar.">

![Do place text inline with the progress bar.](images/progress-bar-usage-12.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not embed text into the progress bar.">

![Do not place the label far away from the progress bar](images/progress-bar-usage-13.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do place text close to the progress bar.">

![Do not place the label far away from the progress bar](images/progress-bar-usage-15.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

#### Internationalization (RTL)

For RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the progress bar is mirrored
for both determinate and indeterminate options. The label is right-aligned, the
value is left-aligned, and the fill progresses from right to left. Keep in mind
that the placement of the percent sign differs depending on the locale.

</Row>

## Content

Determinate and indeterminate progress bars both have a label and an optional
helper text. However, the indeterminate can’t provide the exact, quantitative
information about the progression in the optional helper text.

#### Labels

- Labels inform users what information the progress bar is processing.
- Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a single line of text.
- Labels should never change as the progress bar is loading.

#### Helper text

- Helper text is used to show additional information about the process taking
  place.
- Common use cases of helper text for a progress bar can either be a generic
  phrase, for example “Fetching assets…”, or it can indicate an exact amount of
  something to be completed, for example "42/256 items".
- When indicating a loading percentage, the percentage number should count up as
  the bar progresses.

## Universal behaviors

### States

There are three states for the progress bar: active, success, and error. These
states also apply on both indeterminate and determinate progress bars. After the
process completes successfully or unsuccesfully, a progress bar can either
remain persistent as confirmation or validation, or it can be automatically
dismissed depending on what is most suitable for the use case.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Progress bar states](images/progress-bar-usage-16.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Active

The active loading state indicates that the action is still in progress.

#### Successful

The success loading state indicates that the action completed successfully.

#### Error

The error loading state indicates that the action did not successfully complete.
If an error occurs, an inline notification or error handling within the form
should appear. As soon as a process fails, the current visual progress remains
visible but the indicator bar's progress stops in place and spans full width.

<Row>
<Column colLg='8'>

<Video src={localVideo3} poster={localPoster3} />

<Caption>
  The example shows the progress bar with error remains persistent as
  confirmation inside the image tile.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg='8'>

<Video src={localVideo4} poster={localPoster4} />

<Caption>
  The example shows thep progress bar is automatically dismissed once it’s done
  uploading.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Interactions

#### Part of a page

While the progress bar is processing information on part of a page, you can
still interact with other elements on the page. When the progress bar finishes
processing it can either remain persistant on the page for confirmation or
automatically dismiss itself depending on the use case.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Progress bar as a part of a page](images/progress-bar-usage-19.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Inside a container

While the progress bar is processing information that could affect multiple
pieces of content within a container, such as a card, depending on the use case,
the whole container should become inactive until processing has been completed
or the specific section within the container being processed should become
inactive until processing has been completed. The user should be able to
interact with the rest of the container or page that is unaffected by the
progress bar.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Progress bar inside a container](images/progress-bar-usage-20.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Modifiers

#### Transitions

An indeterminate bar can change to a determinate indicator (finishing from left
to right) when enough information is gathered to end the load animation.

<Row>
  <Column colLg="8">
    <Video src={localVideo5} poster={localPoster5} />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Accessibility

- The loading component is implemented using the ARIA 1.1 progressbar pattern.
  It outputs an ARIA `role="progressbar"` and uses `aria-valuemin`,
  `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` to convey the loaded percentage to screen
  reader users.

- If the progress bar shows the loading of a specific part or region of the
  applicaition, set `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-describedly="[progressbar-id]"`
  on the related element to ensure assistive technologies can correctly convey
  this relation to the user.

- Only hide the label when it is absolute clear to the user which process the
  progress bar represents. Note that you are still required to pass an
  appropriate label which will be read by screen readers.
