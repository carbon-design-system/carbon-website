The structured list React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success
criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and violations have been identified
as high priority issues. This document will be updated when these
accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. The structured list headers accurately describe the data contained in the rows and columns.
2. If the structured list has a labels it should be clear and concise.
3. If the structured list has a caption or description, `aria-describedby` should be set on the table element with a value referring to the element containing the description.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been performed on the structure list React Carbon Component. [WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
