## Overview

Structured list displays a simple list with a considerable amount of items of
read-only values. It helps organize and present grouped information into logical
and scannable patterns. The content within a list can be stacked to create
hierarchy within the data.

#### When to use

- To browse information or select certain information within the group in the
  simplest form
- To view description and detailed information, present features, or compare
  pricing plans

#### When not to use

Nesting items is not recommended, as structured lists are used to present simple
data. If you have more than 25 items or additional content that needs to be
shown, consider using a
[data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/),
which supports nesting items and presents a larger set of content.

| Variant      | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Default_    | Allows the user to quickly browse and view information within a group of data |
| _Selectable_ | Allows the user to mark or select a desired option within a group of data     |

## Formatting

### Anatomy

Structured list is composed of two sections—column header and data row.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Structured list anatomy](images/structured-list-usage-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Column header**: Shows titles for the row header description.
2. **Data row**: Shows different types of data. Rows can be selectable and
   modified to show alternating zebra stripe background colors

### Sizing

The structured list is available in two different sizes in height: default and
condensed. The structure list's width varies based on content and layout.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![data table anatomy](images/structured-list-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Alignment

The structured list is available in two alignment styles: hang and flush
alignment.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![data table anatomy](images/structured-list-usage-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Content

- A maximum of three paragraphs of text is recommended per row.
- A structured list’s title and row information should use sentence-case
  capitalization.

#### Column header titles

- Column header titles should be short and clear, sticking to one or two words
  that describe the data in that column.
- In cases where a column header title is too long, wrap the text to two lines
  and then truncate the rest of the text. The full text should be shown in a
  tooltip on hover.
- Column header titles should use sentence-case capitalization.

## Interactions

#### Selectable structured list

- Only one item can be selected from the list.
- By default, one option should be selected.
- If you need to select multiple items, use a
  [data table.](/components/data-table/usage)
- When the user selects an item from the list, the selected row will appear with
  the `checkmark--filled` icon.
