## Overview

Structured list displays a simple list with a considerable amount of items in
multiple rows. Structured list helps organize and present grouped information
into logical and scannable patterns. The content within a structured list can be
stacked to create hierarchy within the data. Structured lists can have read-only
or selectable rows.

### When to use

- To browse information or select certain information within the group in the
  simplest form
- To view description and detailed information, present features, or compare
  pricing plans

### When not to use

Nesting items is not recommended, as structured lists are used to present simple
data. If you have more than 25 items or additional content that needs to be
shown, consider using a
[data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/),
which supports nesting items and presents a larger set of content.

### Variants

| Variant                   | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Default](#default)       | Allows the user to quickly browse and view information within a group of data                                          |
| [Selectable](#selectable) | Allows the user to mark or select a desired option within a group of data. This variant has an available feature flag. |

### Feature flags

A feature flag has been added to the selectable variant of structured list to
improve accessibility and changes its visual appearance, not its functionality.
For code-specific feature flag information, refer to the
[Code](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/code/) tab. The
current selectable structured list is not being deprecated, but teams are
encouraged to use the feature flag structured list for their products moving
forward.

- Icons have been changed from checkmark icons to radio button icons and appear
  in the enabled state instead of only on hover before making a selection.
- Positioning of icons appear on the left of the component instead of on the
  right.

## Formatting

### Sizing

The structured list is available in two different height sizes: **default** and
**condensed**. The structure list's width varies based on content and layout.

<Column colLg={12}>

<Caption> Default and condensed height sizes for structured list </Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Alignment

The structured list is available in two alignment styles: **hang** and
**flush**. The flush alignment is not offered with selectable functionality.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Hang and flush alignment for structured list](images/structured-list-usage-alignment.png)

<Caption> Hang and flush alignment for structured list </Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Content

#### Row text

- A maximum of three paragraphs of text is recommended per row.
- Row text should use sentence-case capitalization.

#### Column header titles

- Column header titles should be short and clear, sticking to one or two words
  that describe the data in that column.
- In cases where a column header title is too long, wrap the text to two lines
  and then truncate the rest of the text. The full text should be shown on
  hover.
- Column header titles should use sentence-case capitalization.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see
Carbon’s [content guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/).

## Default

Default structured lists are used to display information to the user, such as
pricing plans. These structured lists can have internal calls-to-action (CTAs),
such as a [button](/components/button/usage) or
a [link](/components/link/usage).

<Column colLg={12}>

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Column header**: Displays title text in each column header
2. **Data row**: Contains different types of data in each row. Rows can be
   modified to have an optional background color

### States

The default structured list has an **enabled** and **skeleton** state and no
interactive states because it is not operable by a mouse or keyboard. For more
information on default structured list states, see the
[Style](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/style/) tab.

## Selectable

Selectable structured lists work well for presenting options to a user in an
ordered manner to make a selection, such as a set of pricing plans.

Selectable structured list has an available feature flag.

   modified to have a background color
3. **Icon**: An icon to indicate that the row is selectable

### States

The selectable structured list has the following states: **enabled**, **hover**,
**focu**s, **selected**, **disabled**, and **skeleton**. For more information on
selectable structured list states, see the
[Style](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/style/) tab.

| State    | When to use                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled  | When the list is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. |
| Hover    | When a user’s mouse cursor is hovering over the structured list row.                                                                                |
| Focus    | When a user tabs or clicks on a row, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                           |
| Selected | When a user presses space or clicks on a structured list row to select it.                                                                          |
| Disabled | When a user is not allowed to interact with the structured list due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites.                         |
| Skeleton | Use on an initial page load to indicate that the structured list has not yet fully loaded.                                                          |

### Interactions

#### Mouse

- The selectable structured list can be operated by a mouse by clicking on an
  individual row to select or deselect it.
- Rows are unselected by default, and only one row can be selected at a time.
- Product teams can build in logic to provide preselection of a row based on the
  use case. If multiple row selection is needed, use a
  [data table](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/)
  instead.

#### Keyboard

- `Tab` moves focus forward to the next following row.
- `Space` selects a row.
- `Up` and `Down` arrow keys move focus to previous and next rows.

### Clickable areas

The selectable structured list rows are clickable. You can click anywhere on the
row to select or deselect it.

## Modifiers

is only available for the hang alignment.
