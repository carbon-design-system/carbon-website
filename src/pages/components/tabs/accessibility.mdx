Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard tabs component, also called a tablist, Carbon already incorporates
accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interactions

Like content switchers, tablists can be automatic or manual. In both instances,
the tablist takes one keyboard tab stop. Tabbing away from the tablist, focus
will either go to the first operable element in the tabpanel or, where there are
no operable elements, the entire tabpanel will take focus to support scrolling
of its content.

  <DoDont type="do" caption="The tablist takes a single tabstop, with focus then moving to the first item in the tabpanel.">

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Where a tabpanel has no interactive items, the focus moves from the tablist to the entire tabpanel.">

![A user tabs through a tablist. The focus goes from the tablist to the whole tabpanel, which contains only text.](images/tab-accessibility-1b.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

Arrow keys are used to navigate between individual tab items but automatic and
manual tablists differ in how the tab items are activated. The following
illustration shows what will happen for each variant when a right arrow key is
pressed with the Overview tab selected and focused.

For automatic tablists, focus and selection are synchronized. When the user
arrows to a tab, it is selected and the tabpanel under the tab is updated in
real time.

Manual tablists allow the user to arrow between the tab items without updating
the tabpanel underneath. When the user right arrows, the Overview tab remains
selected while focus moves to the Details tab. In order to select the Details
tab (and update the tabpanel under the tab) the user would press `Enter` or
`Space`.

  and Enter keys are used to select a tab after arrowing to it in a manual
  variant.

</Row>

#### Scrollable tabs operation

Especially with contained tabs, it is possible for the number of tab items in
the tablist to exceed the available horizontal space.Carbon offers the ability
to scroll sideways within the list. For keyboard users, the navigation is the
same. The user presses the `Left` or `Right` arrow keys, which moves the focus
to the next tab item and where necessary scrolls the tablist to keep the
selected item visible. When the end of the tablist is reached, the focus wraps
to the opposite end of the list. For mouse users, clickable arrows appear at the
end of the tablist to provide the same scrolling, but these are not needed for
keyboard users and they are not in the focus order. This is interaction is
demonstrated on the React storybook for the
[Contained Full Width tabs](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-tabs--contained-full-width#storybook-preview-wrapper)
variant.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>
  Arrows keys both move between tabs in the tablist, and scroll the tablist
  display as needed to keep the focused tab visible.

</Column>
</Row>

## Design recommendations

### Indicate which variant to implement

The automatic and manual tablists are visually indistinguishable in a wireframe,
so designers should annotate which variant the team has decided to implement.
Since the choice largely concerns technical considerations about potential
latency when updating the tabpanel’s information, architects or developers
should be involved in the discussion.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Tabs are implemented as a `tablist`, with each content tab implemented as a
  `<button>` with a role of `tab`.
- The selected content tab has attributes `aria-selected="true"` and
  `tabindex="0"`. All other tabs have these attribute values set to `"false"`
  and `"-1"`.
- See the
  [ARIA authoring practices guidance for tabs](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tabpanel)
  for more considerations.
- For accessibility considerations for manual tabs, see
  [Deciding when to make selection automatically follow focus](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_selection_follows_focus).
