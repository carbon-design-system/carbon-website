## Accessibility considerations

1. Each tab must have a unique title that clearly describes tab panel content.
   This is particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have
   the necessary information to efficiently navigate the content.
2. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within
   each tab panel.
3. Content authors need to ensure the content that is added to the tab panel is
   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the panel you need to include
   alternative text to pass accessibility testing.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been
performed on the structure list React Carbon Component.
[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues
have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available
in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
