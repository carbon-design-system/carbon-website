The tabs React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success

## Accessibility considerations

1. Each tab must have a unique title that clearly describes tab panel content. This is particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the necessary information to efficiently navigate the content.
2. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within each tab panel.
3. Content authors need to ensure the content that is added to the tab panel is accessible. For example, if you add an image to the panel you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been performed on the structure list React Carbon Component. [WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
