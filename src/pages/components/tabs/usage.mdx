## Overview

Tabs are used to group different but related content, allowing users to navigate
views without leaving the page. Tabs can be used on full page layouts or in
components such as modals, cards, or side panels.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![An example of tabs being used.](images/tab-usage-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### When to use

To help reduce cognitive load, use tabs to group related information into
different categories. Tabs can be used to organize content such as forms,
settings, and dashboards so a user does not have to navigate away from their
workflow to complete their task.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![tab thumbnail.](images/tab-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### When not to use

#### Filtering the same content

When toggling between between different formats of the same content or filtering
the same content, use a content switcher instead. Content switcher is often used
alongside tabs, but it typically serves at a lower hierarchy to organize related
content within the tab’s contents.

#### Indicating progress

When the user needs to work through a step by step linear process, use a
progress indicator. Tabs help organize information hierarchically but remain
flexible in how content can be designed and consumed.

#### Comparing information

Tabs should not be used if the user needs to compare information in different
groups, as this would result in the user having to click back and forth to
complete a task.

### Variants

| Variant                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Formatting

The tab component consists of two distinct zones: selected and unselected. One
tab is always selected by default. There are always at least two tabs in
non-dismissible tab groups and at least one in dismissible tab groups. Icons are
optional.

### Alignment

Much like
[buttons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#alignment),
alignment of tabs depends on where they appear and whether or not they're
contained within another component. As a general rule, the first label for both
line tabs and contained tabs align with the grid and the text below. If tabs are
within another component, such as a card, follow the grid that you are using
inside the component and align the label with text in the component.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do align tab labels with the grid">

![Do align tab labels with the grid](images/tab-usage-6-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not align tab container with the grid">

![Do not align tab container with the grid](images/tab-usage-6-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

#### Auto-width

With both line tabs and contained tabs, auto-width is the default behavior. Each
tab will be a different size depending on the label's character count but will
have consistent padding on each side of the label. The first label, selected by
default, should align to the grid. Where the tabs end will vary and may not end
on the grid. If needed, you may also use a line to help balance tabs with other
components on the page.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Autowidth tabs](images/tab-usage-7.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Example of auto-width line tabs using a rule</Caption>

#### Aligning to grid columns

Instead of using the default auto-width behavior, contained tabs also have the
option to align to the grid. As a group, the tabs span a set of columns with
each tab being equal in size. The first tab’s label should align to the first
column you are using with the last tab in the group always ending at a column’s
edge. The tabs in between will flow accordingly and may or may not align to the
grid but will always be the same size.

Use the
[2x grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview#2x-grid-fundamentals)
to drive visual rhythm by spacing content in multiples of two columns and
aligning the beginning and ending of the tab elements with content below the
tabs when possible.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Grid aligned tabs are not currently implemented in the components.
Updates for grid alignment are incoming.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Aligning to grid columns](images/tab-usage-8.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Example of contained tabs using the grid</Caption>

#### Alignment within a component

When using line tabs within a component (like a modal) the first label should
always align to the other content in the space. Do not use contained tabs. The
edges of the line tab may also bleed to the edges of the space if needed
depending on the container's margins. To add hierarchical clarity and balance
the tabs with the other content, a line may be added from the end of the last
tab to the edge of the content area.

<Column colLg={8}>

## Content

### Main elements

#### Labels

- Use short tab labels that are clear and specific. Labels should be one to two
  words, as these are easier to scan.
- Text labels should clearly communicate the view users will see and the content
  contained in the view.

#### Secondary labels

- Contained tabs can have secondary labels to add clarity or assist the user in
  choosing the right selection.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Universal behaviors

### States

Tabs have two states—**selected,** and **unselected,**. Other interactive states
are **hover, focus,** and **disabled**. The default view is one tab is
preselected and is usually the first tab. Only one tab can be selected at a
time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous tab is automatically
deselected. If a user navigates away from a tab, a user should return to the
last tab selected.

For detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see
the [Style tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/style).

| State      | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Selected   | When a user clicks or uses the arrows keys to activate tab.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Hover      | When a user is hovering over the tag with the mouse cursor to interact with it.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Focus      | When a user clicks on the tag or navigates using the keyboard with left and right arrows, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                                                                           |
| Unselected | When the user navigates to another tab and the tab is inactive.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Disabled   | When a user is not allowed to interact with the tab due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites. The disabled state completely removes the interactive function from a component. The styling is not subject to WCAG contrast compliance. |

### Scrollable

When your page requires more tabs that can fit or needs to adapt to a new
browser size, tabs should become scrollable. Left and right arrows appear to
help navigate the user through tabs that might be off-page.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of line and contained tabs that scroll](images/tab-usage-11.png)

</Row>

<Caption>

</Caption>

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Users can trigger a state change by clicking anywhere in the container area.

#### Keyboard

One tab should be selected by default. Users can navigate between tabs by
pressing right or left arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions, see the
[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).

#### Automatic and manual

Automatic and manual tablists differ in how the tab items are activated.

For automatic tablists, focus and selection are synchronized. When the user
arrows to a tab, it becomes selected, and the tab panel under the tab is updates
automatically.

Manual tablists allow the user to arrow between the tab items without updating
the tab panel underneath. When the user navigates using arrows, the selected tab
remains selected while focus moves to the next tab. In order to select the
focused tab (and update the tabpanel under the tab), the user would press Enter
or Space.

## Line tabs

A line tab is standalone tab that can also be nested within components. Although
it is commonly used within components, such as a modal or header, line tabs can
also be used for large content areas using the entire page for layout, not
connected to any other components. Line tabs are highly flexible and can be
placed on background or layer tokens, making it easy to use in many different
scenarios. To help define the tabpanel, which is the content area below the
selected tab, a line can be used that extends from the tablist to the end of the
panel. This is currently not part of the Carbon line tabs component and must be
added by teams is desired.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Examples of tabs with icons](images/tab-usage-13.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Contained tabs

Contained tabs are an emphasized tab commonly used for defined content areas
like sub-pages. Contained tabs are always attached to a tabpanel (background
container) that uses the same layer token as the selected tab. Since the
contained tabs are on layers, the tab content tends stands out against the
background and maintains a high visual hierarchy while line tabs tend to blend
into content more easily. Because of the layering model, be mindful of the
layers used within the tabs so the content does not get too visually
complicated, especially within smaller areas.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Examples of tabs with icons](images/tab-usage-14.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Modifiers

### Tabs with icons

You may use icons in either line or contained tabs. Icons are always pinned to
the right of the tab and do not appear above, below, or to the left of the
label.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of contained tabs with icons](images/tab-usage-15.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Example of contained tabs with icons.</Caption>

### Icon-only tabs

You may use icon-only tabs with both line and contained tabs. Icons must be
easily recognized and globally accepted. These work best in small, defined
spaces and in components. Always use a tooltip for an icon description on hover
to add clarity.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of icon-only tabs within a side panel](images/tab-usage-16.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Example of icon-only tabs within a side panel.</Caption>

### Secondary labels

Contained tabs that align with the grid allow for a secondary label. Do not use
secondary labels with line tabs or auto-width contained tabs.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of contained tabs with a secondary labe and icon](images/tab-usage-17.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>Example of contained tabs with a secondary label and icon.</Caption>

### Dismissible tabs

Dismissible tabs allow users to close tabs providing a focused and relevant
experience. Users can add or remove tabs as needed, accommodating future content
additions or modifications without drastically changing the overall layout or
structure.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Dismissible tabs](images/tab-usage-18.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>
  Example of dismissible line tabs (top) and dismissible contained tabs (bottom)
</Caption>

#### When to use

- Use dismissible tabs to offer flexibility and scalability in complex
  interfaces that require users to create multiple sections or modules.
- Use dismissible tabs for content created or curated by the user.
- Use to focus a specific data set or search results.

#### When not to use

- Do not use when tabs contain frequently used or critical information.
- Do not use as navigation.

#### Dismissible tabs with icons

Carbon provides an option to include icons within the dismissible tabs. Only use
icons within dismissible tabs if all tabs will include icons. Do not mix
dismisible tabs without icons with dismissible tabs with icons.

#### Dismissing a tab

When dismissing a tab, an inline warning or modal may be used when information
contained in a tab will no longer be accessible or difficult to retrieve. Since
warnings, especially modals, are highly disruptive, only use when the dismissal
causes errors, unintentional deletions, or unsaved changes.

#### Triggering a new tab

There are various ways to trigger a new tab. The trigger button can visually
change its shape and size depending on the use case. Keep the trigger close
enough to the new tab to associate the add action with the new tab item. The
order of tabs can be ascending or descending depending on use case but do keep
them in a sequential, logical order.

If all tabs are dismissible, make sure a user understands how to trigger new
tabs once the tabs are gone. Provide visual cues, such as a container or
placeholder tab, so the user clearly understands that the trigger button is
creating a new tab in a place they expect.

## Related

#### Content switcher versus tabs

[Content switchers](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/)
allow users to compare and toggle between alternate views of similar or related
content. Content that is grouped into tabs is part of the same bigger context
but the content does not overlap.

#### Navigation versus tabs

Tabs should not be used for common navigation patterns. If your tab arrangements
are becoming too complex with different levels of content, consider using
[left](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/)
or
[right](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/)
UI panels, possibly in conjunction with breadcrumbs, to help the user through
the content.

#### Progress indicator versus tabs

[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage/)
content moves in a logical progression, showing next steps to guide the user
through the completion of a task. Tabs organize content into groups that the
user can navigate through; they do not support progressive tasks.
