## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

Read-only tags are not in the tab order, are not interactive, and do not receive
focus.

Dismissible tags are in the tab order and receive focus around the close icon.
Pressing `Enter` or `Space` will dismiss the tag. Tabbing away from the tag will
move focus to the next element in the tab order.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Selectable tags are in the tab order and focus is shown around each tag.
Pressing `Enter` or `Space` toggles the selection on and off.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Operational tags are in the tab order and focus is shown around each tag.
Pressing `Enter` or `Space` will disclose additional related tags.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Design recommendations

Design annotations are not needed, but keep the following point in mind.

When the tag's title is too long to fit within the available space of the tag
container, the title can be truncated with an ellipsis. By mouse, the full title
is disclosed in a browser tooltip on hover. By keyboard, the full title is
disclosed on focus in a tooltip. Truncation should be set at the title's start,
middle, or end, depending on what is best for the given use case.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>

  keyboard.

## Developer considerations

Keep this in mind if you’re modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

- Do not add an `onClick` functionality to the dismissible tag, and only reserve
  interactions for the close icon in the tag.
- Do not nest buttons within the operational tag. Consider using the `as` prop
  to change an element tag to avoid nesting buttons.
