No accessibility annotations are needed for tags, but keep these considerations
in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

Read-only tags are not in the tab order, are not interactive, and do not receive
focus.

Dismissible tags are in the tab order and receive focus around the close icon by
pressing the tab key. Pressing the enter or space keys will dismiss, close, or
remove the tag. Tabbing away from the tag will move focus to the next element in
the tab order.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>

  potentially dismiss the tag.

Selectable tags are in the tab order and the the tag container receives focus by
pressing the tab key. While the tag has focus, pressing the enter key or space
key will select or deselect the tag. If navigating within a group of tags, use
the tab key to move focus to and from different tags in the group. Tabbing away
from the last tag in the group will move focus to the next element in the tab
order.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

  select or deselect.

Operational tags are in the tab order and the tag container receives focus by
pressing the tab key. Pressing the enter or space keys will disclose additional
related tags, in a toggletip, popover, modal, or breadcrumb view. Closing the
disclosed view or navigating away from it can vary depending on the method being
used. After closing the disclosed view, tabbing away from the tag will move
focus to the next element in the tab order.

<Column colLg={8}>

## Developer considerations

Keep this in mind if youâ€™re modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## Accessibility testing

Accessibility issues are tracked in the
[Carbon Component GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22type%3A+a11y+%E2%99%BF%22+label%3A%22component%3A+tag%22+)

                group press Control-Option-Shift-Down Arrow." (Note: There is an
                open issue. VO does not announce the "X" clear filter when Tab
                is pressed immediately after the Tag text is read.)
