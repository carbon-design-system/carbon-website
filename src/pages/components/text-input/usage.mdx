## Overview

Text inputs enable users to enter free-form text data. The type of text field
used should reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter. The
default text input is for short, one-line content, whereas text area is for
longer, multi-line entries.

#### When to use

- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a
  preset of options.
- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a
  free-hand format versus a more complex control.

#### When not to use

- If a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a
  free-form text input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a
  selection control such as a dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Label**: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in
   the field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.
2. **Value**: The content the user has entered into the field.
3. **Helper text** (optional): Assistive text that can provide additional aid or
   context to the user. Often used to explain the correct data format.
4. **Field**: The container in which a user enters data. Must meet 3:1 non-text
   contrast requirements.
5. **Input requirement** (optional): This label indicates if the field is
   optional or required for the user to complete.
6. **Character counter** (text area only): Indicate the number of characters
   being entered and the total number of characters allowed.
7. **Resize handle** (text area only): Allows a user to manipulate the field
   height by making it longer or shorter.

### Sizing

#### Text input heights

There are three text input height sizes: small, medium, and large. Supporting
three sizes gives you more flexibility in structuring layouts. Be sure to use a
consistent field height when pairing form components on the same page.

| Size        | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small (sm)  | 32 / 2          | Use when space is constricted or when placing a text input in a form that is long and complex.                                                      |
| Medium (md) | 40 / 2.5        | This is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.                                                       |
| Large (lg)  | 48 / 3          | Use when there is a lot of space to work with. The large size is typically used in simple forms or when a text input is placed by itself on a page. |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Text input heights](images/text-input-usage-size.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Text area height

Text area has a variable height that can be lengthened or shortened by the user
using the `resize` handle in the bottom right of the field. By default, text
area has a minimum height of 40px/2.5rem but no maximum height.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Text input heights](images/text-area-usage-size.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Widths

The field widths of both text input and text area should reflect the intended
length of the content while still aligning to the grid columns or mini unit
grid. Unlike the height, the width of the text area cannot be controlled by the
user. There are no minimum or maximum widths but you should avoid excessively
wide fields that are disproportionate to the intended data being collected.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do make text input widths proportional to the content and align to grid columns.">

![Do use proportional widths](images/text-input-width-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not make text inputs excessively wide just to fill in space.Â ">

![Do not make inputs excessively wide.](images/text-input-width-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Alignment

Labels and field containers should vertically align to the grid and with other
form components on a page.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do align field containers to the grid.">

![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/text-input-usage-4-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.">

![Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.](images/text-input-usage-4-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

## Content

### Main elements

#### Labels

Effective labeling helps users understand what information to enter into a text
input. Text fields should always have a label. There are rare instances were the
context of an input negates the need for a visible label but we advise you
consult an accessibility expert before proceeding with a label-less design.

- Use sentence-style capitalization for all labels, except for product names and
  proper nouns.
- Keep the label short and concise.
- Labels should clearly state the requirement status.
- Do not use colons after label names.

#### Helper text

Optional helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in correctly
completing a field. It is often used to explain the correct data format.

- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full
  sentences with punctuation.
- Helper text is an optional feature and can be used in place of a tooltip.
- When used, helper text is always available when the input is focused and
  appears underneath the field. The exceptions are when an error or warning
  message replaces the helper text.

#### Placeholder text

Optional placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter.
Placeholder text disappears after the user begins entering data into the input
and should not contain crucial information.

- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as a
  direct statement without punctuation.
- Placeholder text is not required and by default not shown in text input
  fields.
- Placeholder text can be harmful to user interactions and should only be added
  when necessary.

#### Accessibility best practices

- Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus.
- Ensure the helper text that appears under an input is read when an assistive
  technology user stops at an input using ARIA.

### Overflow content

#### Overflow in a text input

If a user's content is unexpectedly too long for the single line of a text input
then the value content can horizontally scroll inside the field container when
moving the cursor from one end of the value to the other.

#### Overflow in a text area

If a user's content exceeds the vertical space of the variable text area then a
user can either expand the field container using the resize handle or they can
vertically scroll the content inside the set field container.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).

## Universal behaviors

The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all variants. For
behaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant
sections below.

### States

| State       | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Enabled_   | When a text input is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. An enabled text input field can contain no content, placeholder text, or user generate content.           |
| _Active_    | When a user is actively typing content into the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| _Focus_     | When a user `tabs` to or clicks on the text input, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                                                                                                                           |
| _Error_     | When the user input is invalid or a required text input has not been filled in. It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.                                                        |
| _Warning_   | When you need to call the user's attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.                                                                                                                 |
| _Disabled_  | When the user is not allowed to interact with the text input due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites. The disabled state completely removes the interactive function from a component. The styling is not subject to WCAG contrast compliance. |
| _Skeleton_  | Use on an initial page load to indicate that the text input has not yet fully loaded.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _Read-only_ | _Coming soon!_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Text input states](images/text-input-states.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Validation

Real-time validation helps streamline the process and keep data clean when the
user fills out forms. Otherwise, validate the text input data when the user
submits the associated form. For complete guidance on error and validation, see
the [form pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern/).

#### Invalid

An error state is triggered if the data is invalid or a required field is left
empty. Error states have three visual indicators to signify invalid content: a
red border, an error icon indicator, and an error message.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an error state being triggered](images/text-input-usage-2.gif)

</Column>
</Row>

### Default values

Where possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill inputs to
reduce errors and save time. When the software canât determine the value that
belongs in an input, use type-ahead to make suggestions. Use sentence-case for
default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.

### Required vs. optional

Text inputs can be labeled as either optional or required depending on the
depending on the circumstance. For more guidance on requirement labeling, see
the [form pattern](/patterns/forms-pattern/#optional-vs.-mandatory).

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont
colMd={4} colLg={4}
caption="If the majority of the fields are required, mark only the optional field labels with (optional).">

![Example showing optional field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-optional-do.png)

</DoDont>
<DoDont
colMd={4} colLg={4}
caption="If the majority of the fields are optional, mark only the required field labels with (required).">

![Example showing required field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-required-do.png)

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Users can activate a text input by clicking on the field container. A separate
click is required to activate any additional actions associated with the text
input such as a tooltip or password visibility toggle.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example showing click target areas for text input](images/text-input-usage-mouse.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

For additional keyboard interactions, see the
[accessibility tab](/components/text-input/accessibility).

| Key                                   | Interaction                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Tab_                                 | Brings focus to the text input.                                                        |
| _Enter_ or _Space_                    | Opens any associated actions added to the input, such as a password visibility toggle. |
| _Esc_                                 | Closes any associated actions added to the input.                                      |
| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _left/right arrows_ | Moves you word by word inside the field.                                               |
| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _up/down arrows_    | Relocates you to the start or end of the input content.                                |

## Text input

Use a text input when the expected user input is a single line of text. Text
inputs have a fixed height and are used as a simple free-form data entry. Users
can enter any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of text input in context](images/text-input-usage-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Password input

Password input is a sub-variant of text input. It is used to collect private
data and will hide the characters as a user enters them. A user can choose to
toggle on the character visibility by clicking the view icon on the far right of
the input field. When using a password input be sure to provide detailed helper
text listing any requirements related to the data format, such as types of
characters allowed or date structure.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a password input](images/text-input-usage-password.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Text area

Use a text area when the expected user input is more than a few words and could
span multiple lines. It is commonly used for features like user commentary or
descriptions. It supports all the same states and functionality as text input
except for the password functionality. Text area has several unique
functionalities not included in the default text input, like the resize handle
and character counter.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a text area](images/text-input-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Resize handle

Included by default in text area is the `resize` handle. It allows a user to
manipulate the field height by making it longer or shorter. The resize handle
has no effect on the width of the text area container, it only effects the
height. If the user makes the field size shorter than the content inside the
field then a vertical scroll will become available.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example showing the resize handle in text area](images/text-area-usage-resize.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Character counter

A character counter can be added to text area to indicate both the number of
characters being entered and the total number of characters allowed. Once the
max number of characters is reached the text area should prevent the user from
entering any additional character and provide messaging to the user that a limit
has been met.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example showing a character counter in text area](images/text-area-usage-counter.png)

</Column>
