Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard tile component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

#### Non-interactive and interactive tiles

A tile can serve as a non-interactive container that holds interactive elements
or actions, such as buttons and links. Alternatively, it can be directly
interactive—clickable, selectable, or expandable—without containing any
interactive elements inside.

For non-interactive tiles, users can press `Tab` to navigate between actionable
elements within a tile or tile group. After navigating through the last
interactive element within a tile, users can press `Tab` to move outside of the
tile—to the next tile in the group (if there is a group of tiles) or to the next
component in the tab order.

For interactive tiles, users can press `Tab` to navigate between the tiles
themselves. When tabbing through these tiles, a focus indicator appears around
the currently selected tile, providing a visual cue that it is focused and ready
to be interacted with. Users can press `Enter` to activate a clickable tile.

#### Selectable tiles

Selectable tiles can be configured as either single-select or multi-select.

For single-select tiles, the group is treated as a single tab stop. By default,
Carbon does not require any item to be pre-selected. If no selection is made,
focus will land on the first item in the group. Users can navigate through the
items using the arrow keys (up/down or left/right). Pressing `Tab` moves the
focus out of the single-select tile group to the next component.

For multi-select tiles, each tile can be navigated pressing `Tab` and selected
or unselected pressing `Space` or `Enter`.

These behaviors are based on radio button and checkbox components. This
navigation difference is based on the principle that a checkbox represents one
choice as a single element, while a group of radio buttons is treated as a
single element because the buttons work together to form a mutually exclusive
choice.

</Row>

#### Expandable tiles

Similar to non-interactive and interactive tiles, expandable tiles come in two
types: those containing interactive elements and those without.

For non-interactive expandable tiles, users can `Tab` to navigate between
interactive elements within the tile. Once users navigate to the expanding icon
button, pressing `Space` or `Enter` expands or collapses the tile.

For interactive expandable tiles, users can press `Space` or `Enter` to expand
or collapse the tile.

## Design recommendations

Design annotations are needed for the following instance.

### Interactive elements

For highly complex tiles, avoid placing interactive elements on top of a
directly interactive tile, as actions should not overlap on an actionable
surface. Instead, use the base tile (without a border around it) that is
non-interactive.

<Column colLg={8}>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Include descriptive labels for interactive tiles to ensure their purpose is
  clear with. Provide an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to the tile component
  to comply with
  [accessible naming](https://able.ibm.com/rules/archives/latest/doc/en-US/aria_accessiblename_exists.html).
- Decorative images should have an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) while
  informative images should include descriptive `alt` text to convey their
  content.
- See the
  [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for
  more considerations.
