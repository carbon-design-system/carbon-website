## Overview

Carbon ships a basic tile structure that responds to the grid. Based on the
layout structure, tiles can contain type, images and/or a block of color. As
tiles have no pre-set styles for the content within them, the tile component
usage guidance is purposefully high-level. It focuses specifically on the tile
itself, not the structure of the information or interactive elements that the
tile contains—that type of information will be found in the card pattern.

#### Tiles vs. Cards

Tiles are simple and foundational. Cards can be very complex. They are built
upon the tile foundation and have various patterns, multiple actions, overflow
menus, selectable features, etc. Carbon does not have a Card pattern yet, but we
link out to several card patterns within our pattern asset library (PAL)
ecosystem below:

- [Productive vs. Expressive cards](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/card/overview/)
  (Carbon for Cloud & Cognitive).
- [Dashboard cards](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ai-applications/design/patterns/dashboards-v2/overview/#dashboard-cards)
  (AI Applications Design).
- [Card](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card) (Carbon for
  IBM.com).

### When to use

Tiles are reusable components that provide shortcuts to building cards and other
modules. Here are some common use cases for when to use tiles:

- Containing a related group of information or actions.
- Displaying high-level information and metrics on dashboards.
- Guiding users to take actions or navigate.
- Presenting options for single or multiple selections.
- Hiding or showing large amounts of content.

## Tile variants

Tiles can function or be implemented in four ways—read-only, clickable,
selectable, or expandable. These variations of tiles are flexible enough to
support a variety of different use cases when building more complicating card
features.

| Variant                    | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Read-only](#read-only)    | For high-level, short, and digestible content pieces such as features, plans, or services offered.        |
| [Clickable](#clickable)   | For prompting an action, navigating or directing to other pieces of information about the subject matter. |

small typo! should be clickable instead of clikckalbe
| [Selectable](/#selectable) | For presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans.                  |
| [Expandable](#expandable)  | For hiding and revealing a large amount of content in order to focus on specific pieces of info.          |

### Read-only

Read-only tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or
services offered. Read-only tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote
content or on dashboards that are highly interactive. These tiles can have
internal calls-to-action (CTAs), such as a [button](/components/button/usage) or
a [link](/components/link/usage).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of read-only tiles.](images/tile-usage-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Clickable

Clickable tiles can be used as navigational items, where the entire tile is a
clickable state, which redirects the user to a new page. Clickable tiles cannot
contain separate internal CTAs but can contain pictograms, icons, or media such
as illustrations or images.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of clickable tiles.](images/tile-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Selectable

Selectable tiles work well for presenting options to a user in a structured
manner, such as a set of pricing plans. Selectable tiles may contain internal
CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target.

Selectable tiles can either have a single select state working like a
[radio button](/components/radio-button/usage), or multi-select state working as
a [checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Selectable radio-button / single select tiles](images/tile-usage-3.png)

<Caption>Single select tiles work like radio-buttons</Caption>

![Selectable checkbox / multi-select tiles](images/tile-usage-4.png)

<Caption>Multi-select tiles work like checkboxes </Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Expandable

Expandable tiles are helpful for hiding and showing large amounts of content to
a user.  
When expanded, tiles push content down the page. They allow the user to
specifically focus on featured content while having access to the rest of the
information. Expandable tiles can contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if
they are given their own click targets and the click target is reduced to only
the chevron icon.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of expandable tiles.](images/tile-usage-5.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of expandable tiles.](images/tile-usage-6.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Header**: Includes a title, optional label, and the close icon.

2. **Body**: Contains the information and/or controls needed to complete the
   modal's task. It can include message text and components.

### Sizing

The **width** varies depending on three basic grid modes: wide, narrow, and
condensed while the **height** varies depending on the amount of content placed
within it, but still following the aspect ratio.

[Aspect ratios](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/#aspect-ratio)
are written out as a formula of width to height, such as 3:2. It’s important to
remember that while two images can have the same aspect ratio, they can have
varying images sizes.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of expandable tiles.](images/tile-usage-7.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Alignment

Always strive for left alignment whenver possible. Type in tiles should always
be left aligned. Icons or icon buttons can be aligned to either left or right
edge depending on the tiles’ complexity.

For example: In situations where there are both an icon or pictogram with an
icon button, place the icon or pictorgram in the lower left corner of the tile
and move the icon button (action) to the right corner.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of $ui-03 token border between fluid buttons](images/tile-usage-8.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont caption="Do left align icon, link, or text when it is by itself.">

![Do left align icon, link, or text when it is by itself.](images/tile-usage-9.png)

  </DoDont>

  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not right align an icon, link, or text when it is by itself">

![Do not right align an icon, link, or text when it is by itself.](images/tile-usage-10.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

![Do move icon to the right when there is text or link.](images/tile-usage-12.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Placement

#### Tile groups

Tile groups are a useful way of aligning tiles that have a strong relationship.
Tile groups flow horizontally left to right usually and have similar
hierarchical importance like navigation or catalog tiles.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the wide grid.](images/tile-usage-13.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the wide grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the narrow grid.](images/tile-usage-14.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the narrow grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid.](images/tile-usage-15.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid but smaller in width.](images/tile-usage-16.png)

<Caption>
  Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid but smaller in
  width.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Layout

There are three basic layouts for tiles: **standard**, **vertical masonry**, and
**horizontal masonry**. The standard layout will be the most commonly used
version.

- Displaying high-level information and metrics on dashboards.
- A vertical masonry grid can vary in height, but is consistent in width.
- A horizontal masonry grid can vary in width. Rows of tiles may vary in height,
  but the tiles within a row are consistent in height.

<Row>
<Column colLg={4}>

![Standard layout for tiles](/images/tile-usage-17.png)

<Caption>Standard layout for tiles</Caption>

</Column>

<Column colLg={4}>

![An example of the standard layout](/images/tile-usage-18.png)

<Caption>Vertical masonry layout for tiles</Caption>

</Column>

<Column colLg={4}>

![An example of the vertical masonry layout](images/tile-usage-20.png)

<Caption>An example of the vertical masonry layout </Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={4}>

![Horizonal masonry layout for tiles](/images/tile-usage-21.png)

<Caption>Horizonal masonry layout for tiles</Caption>

</Column>

<Column colLg={4}>

![An example of the horizonal masonry layout](images/tile-usage-22.png)

<Caption>An example of the horizonal masonry layout </Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Elevation

Tiles reside in the same plane as the background layer—they do not have
elevation. Do not add drop shadows to tiles. Tiles organize essential
information and have the same visual hierarchy as content within the same page.
Modals, popovers, and dialogs do have elevation but are not inherently part of
the user's main workstream and are invoked on screen to reveal secondary
information, actions, or notifications.

### Call-to-actions

For **read-only, selectable, and expandable tiles**, use `$link-01` when icon and
link are paired together or use $interactive-04 when the icon stands alone.

For **clickable tiles**, don’t highlight text or icons to avoid them being confused as links or clickable.

<DoDontRow>

  <DoDont caption="Do use text or icon for clickable tiles if needed.">

![Do use text or icon for clickable tiles if needed.](images/tile-usage-23.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not use link or highlight the icon color for clickable tiles.">

![Do not use link or highlight the icon color for clickable tiles.](images/tile-usage-24.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

## Behaviors

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Users can trigger an item by clicking anywhere in any tile container, except
read-only tiles.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Clickable, expandable, and selectable tiles are clickable anywhere within the tile.](images/tile-usage-25.png)

<Caption>
  Clickable, expandable, and selectable tiles are clickable anywhere within the
  tile.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Read-only tiles are static, except buttons or links .](images/tile-usage-26.png)

<Caption>Read-only tiles are static, except buttons or links .</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Expandable tiles can either be triggered as a whole or only contain internal
CTA's if they are given their own click targets and the tile’s click target is
reduced to only the chevron icon.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Clickable targets are currently not available in coding. Teams can
override the code to make smaller click targets while we're updating this in the
future.

</InlineNotification>

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Clickable, expandable, and selectable tiles are clickable anywhere within the tile.](images/tile-usage-27.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

Specific keyboard interactions will depend on the type of tile you are using and
what content it contains but all types of tiles can take focus.

| Key             | Interaction                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab             | For high-level, short, and digestible content pieces such as features, plans, or services offered.        |
| Shit + Tab      | For prompting an action, navigating or directing to other pieces of information about the subject matter. |
| Return or Enter | For presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans.                  |
| Space           | For hiding and revealing a large amount of content in order to focus on specific pieces of info.          |
