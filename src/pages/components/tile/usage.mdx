Tiles are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content,
including information, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

[Experimental tiles](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/experimental-improved-contrast-tile--clickable)
are now available. This addition enhances accessibility and only applies to the
visual, not the functions of tiles. Though we are not deprecating the current
tiles, we encourage all design teams to use the new experimental tiles in their
products moving forward.

## Overview

Carbon ships a basic tile structure that responds to the grid. Based on the
layout structure, tiles can contain type, images and/or a block of color. As
tiles have no pre-set styles for the content inside, the tile component usage
guidance focuses on basic tiles' functions. It does not include the complex
structure of the information or additional interactive elements that a tile
contains.

<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Tiles versus Cards

Tiles are simple and foundational. Cards can be very complex. They are built
upon the tile foundation and have various patterns, multiple actions, overflow
menus, selectable features, etc. Carbon does not have a Card pattern yet, but we
link out to several card patterns within our pattern asset library (PAL)
ecosystem below:

- [Productive vs. Expressive cards](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/card/overview/)
  (Carbon for Cloud & Cognitive)
- [Dashboard cards](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ai-applications/design/patterns/dashboards-v2/overview/#dashboard-cards)
  (AI Applications Design)
- [Card](https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/components/card) (Carbon for
  IBM.com)

### When to use

Tiles are reusable components that provide shortcuts to building cards and other
modules. Use tiles as part of the user's main workstream. Here are some common
use cases for when to use tiles:

- To contain related groupings of information or actions
- To guide users to take actions or navigate
- To present options for single or multiple selections
- To hide or show large amounts of content

### When not to use

Tiles reside in the same plane as the background layer—they do not have
**elevation**. Tiles organize essential information and have the same visual
hierarchy as content within the same page.

Do not add a drop shadow to tiles and use them on the screen to reveal secondary
information, actions, or notifications. Use [modals](/components/modal/usage),
[popover](/components/popover/usage), and [dialog](/components/dialog/usage)
which have elevation and are appropriate for this function instead.

## Tile variants

<InlineNotification>

Except for base tiles, experimental tiles are applicable for clickable,
selectable, and expandable tiles.

</InlineNotification>

Tiles can function or be implemented in four ways—base, clickable, selectable,
or expandable. These variations of tiles are flexible enough to support a
variety of different use cases when building more complicated card features.

| Variant                   | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Base](#base)             | For high-level, short, and digestible content pieces such as features, plans, or services offered        |
| [Clickable](#clickable)   | For prompting an action, navigating or directing to other pieces of information about the subject matter |
| [Selectable](#selectable) | For presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans                  |
| [Expandable](#expandable) | For hiding and revealing a large amount of content to focus on specific pieces of info                   |

### Base

Base tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or
services offered. Base tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote
content or on highly interactive dashboards. These tiles can have internal
calls-to-action (CTAs), such as a [button](/components/button/usage) or a
[link](/components/link/usage).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of base tiles](images/tile-usage-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Clickable

Clickable tiles can be used as navigational items, where the entire tile is in a
clickable state, which redirects the user to a new page. Clickable tiles cannot
contain separate internal CTAs but can contain pictograms, icons, or media such
as illustrations or images.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of clickable tiles](images/tile-usage-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Selectable

Selectable tiles work well for presenting options to a user in a structured
manner, such as a set of pricing plans. Selectable tiles may contain internal
CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target.

Selectable tiles can either have a single-select state working like a
[radio button](/components/radio-button/usage), or multi-select state working as
a [checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of radio-button/single-select tile](images/tile-usage-4.png)

<Caption>Single-select tiles</Caption>

![Example image of checkbox/multi-select tile](images/tile-usage-5.png)

<Caption>Multi-select tiles</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Expandable

Expandable tiles are helpful for hiding and showing large amounts of content to
a user. When expanded, tiles push content down the page. They allow the user to
specifically focus on featured content while having access to the rest of the
information. Expandable tiles can contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if
they are given their own click targets.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example image of expandable tile with interactive elements](images/tile-usage-6.png)

<Caption>Expandable tile with interactive elements</Caption>

![Example image of expandable tile without interactive elements](images/tile-usage-7.png)

<Caption>Expandable tile without interactive elements</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Tile anatomy](images/tile-usage-8.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Image (optional)** : The image follows the aspect ratios with the default
   size of 4:3

2. **Container**: Contains the content area

3. **Content area**: Contains the information and/or controls needed to complete
   the modal's task. It can include message text and components.

### Sizing

The **width** varies depending on three basic grid modes: wide, narrow, and
condensed. The **height** varies depending on the amount of content placed
within it, but applies the
[spacing scale](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview/#spacing-scale)
and follows the
[aspect ratio](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/#aspect-ratio).
The minimum height starts with 2:1 aspect ratio. As the content grows, set
vertical spacing between sections within the content area.

### Alignment

#### Icon and call-to-action button

On clickable tiles, use the arrow icon with the `interactive` token in light
themes and the `icon-primary` token for dark themes. Place the icon at the
bottom right to indicate navigation. Avoid using interactive links or buttons
that can be confusing as multiple click targets on clickable tiles.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do right align the icon when it is by itself">

![Example of "do" on clickable tile](images/tile-usage-9.png)

  </DoDont>

  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do right align the icon when there is an additional text">

![Example of "do" on clickable tile](images/tile-usage-10.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

<DoDontRow>

  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do right align the icon when there is an icon or pictogram">

![Example of "do" on clickable tile](images/tile-usage-11.png)

  </DoDont>

  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not add interactive links or components on clickable tiles">

![Example of "do not" on clickable tile](images/tile-usage-12.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

On base tiles, place the interactive link at the bottom left or the button at
the bottom to indicate call-to-action items.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do left align the interactive link at the bottom on base tile">

![Example of "do" on base tile](images/tile-usage-13.png)

  </DoDont>

  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do place the button at the bottom on base tile">

![Example of "do" on base tile](images/tile-usage-14.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

#### Tile groups

Tile groups are a useful way of aligning tiles that have a strong relationship.
Tile groups flow horizontally from left to right usually and have similar
hierarchical importance like navigation or catalog tiles.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the wide grid.](images/tile-usage-15.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the wide grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the narrow grid.](images/tile-usage-16.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the narrow grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid.](images/tile-usage-17.png)

<Caption>Example image of how tiles are built on the condensed grid.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Layout

There are three basic layouts for tiles: **standard**, **vertical masonry**, and
**horizontal masonry**. The standard layout will be the most commonly used
version.

- Standard layout tiles are the same in height and width as the rest of them in
  the group.
- A vertical masonry layout can vary in height, but is consistent in width.
- A horizontal masonry layout can vary in width. Rows of tiles may vary in
  height, but the tiles within a row should be consistent in height.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Layouts for tiles](/images/tile-usage-18.png)

<Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Universal behaviors

The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all variants. For
behaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variants
sections below.

### States

For detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see
the [Style](http://localhost:8000/components/tile/style) tab.

| State      | When to use                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Enabled_  | When a tile is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component    |
| _Hover_    | When a user is hovering over the tile with the mouse cursor to interact with it (except base tile)                                                  |
| _Focus_    | When a user `tabs` to or clicks on the tile, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component (except base tile) |
| _Selected_ | When a user `enters` or clicks on the single-select tile or the multi-select tile to select an option or multiple options                           |

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Users can trigger an item by clicking anywhere in any tile container, except
base tiles.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Clickable, expandable, and selectable tiles are clickable anywhere within the tile.](images/tile-usage-24.png)

<Caption>
  Clickable, expandable, and selectable tiles are clickable anywhere within the
  tile
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Base tiles are static, except buttons or links .](images/tile-usage-25.png)

<Caption>Base tiles are static, except buttons or links</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Expandable tiles can either be triggered as a whole or only contain internal
CTAs if they are given their click targets and the tile’s click target is
reduced to only the icon button.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

  reduced to the icon button
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

Specific keyboard interactions will depend on the type of tile you are using and
what content it contains but all types of tiles can take focus.

| Key             | Interaction                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab             | Move forward through tiles (if tiles themselves are clickable) and interactive elements within the tiles in a logical order                                                |
| Shift + Tab     | Move backward through tiles (if tiles themselves are clickable) and interactive elements within the tiles in a logical order                                               |
| Return or Enter | Return or enter will open the tile (if the tile itself is clickable). If the tile is not clickable but has interactive elements, their corresponding actions are performed |
| Space           | If the tile is selectable, the space bar will toggle tile selection                                                                                                        |
