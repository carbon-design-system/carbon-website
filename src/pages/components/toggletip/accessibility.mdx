<PageDescription>

Carbon already incorporates accessibility into the toggletip component. Designers only need to indicate the toggletipâ€™s content.

## What Carbon provides

No annotations are needed for keyboard operation, since Carbon bakes in the interaction.

### Keyboard interactions

Toggletips use an information icon button for the trigger. When these buttons have focus, pressing `Enter` or `Space` toggles the toggletip open and closed (while focus remains on the trigger). If the toggletip contains interactive elements, pressing `Tab` will move the focus from the trigger into the components in an open toggletip. The toggletip can be closed by pressing `Esc` (which puts focus back on the trigger) or by moving focus away from the toggletip and its trigger.

<Caption>
  The information button ('i') that triggers the toggletip is in the page tab order, as are interactive elements inside an open toggletip.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Column colLg={8}>

![Esc dismisses a toggletip](images/toggletip-accessibility-2.png)

<Caption>
  Toggletips appear on activation of the information button ('i'), and disappear by either activating the icon again, pressing Esc or moving focus to another element.

</Column>
</Row>

## Design recommendations

### Annotate the text for the toggletip

Every toggletip should be annotated by the designer so the developer knows what content it has. See [Usage](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/toggletip/usage) for information on the length and styling of toggletip content.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![annotation shows the text of the toggletip](images/toggletip-accessibility-3.png)

<Caption>Specify the content that will appear in the toggletip.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Button trigger uses `aria-expanded` to set toggletip visibility and `aria-controls` to handle navigation to the content.
- See the toggletip pattern in the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#toggletip) for more considerations.
