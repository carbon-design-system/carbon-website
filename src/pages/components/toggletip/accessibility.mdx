## What Carbon provides

Carbon already incorporates accessibility into the toggletip component. Designers only need to indicate the toggletip’s content.

### Keyboard interactions

Toggletips use an information icon button for the trigger. These buttons are in the tab order and are activated by pressing `Enter` or `Space`. The activation toggles the tip open and closed. Focus remains on the trigger.

Where the toggletip contains interactive elements, pressing `Tab` will move the focus into the first of the components in the toggletip. Where the toggletip contains only non-interactive text, or where the focus is on the last component in the toggletip, pressing `Tab` will close the toggletip and move focus to the next tab stop on the page.
Pressing `Esc` also closes an open toggletip and, if the focus is inside the tip, returns focus to the trigger.

  Toggletips appear on activation of the information icon, and disappear by either activating the icon again, pressing Esc, or moving focus to another element.

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- The information icon button has `aria-label="Show information"`.
- The button uses `aria-expanded` to set toggletip visibility and `aria-controls` to handle navigation to the content.
