The tooltip React Carbon component has been tested against the latest
[W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
and violations have been identified as high priority issues. This document will
be updated when these accessibility issues are resolved.

## Accessibility considerations

1. After the tooltip opens, initial focus should be set on the first focusable
   element in the tooltip. See WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
   [Modal Dialog Example, Accessibility Features section](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html)
   for best practices on setting focus. Note: This does not apply to the tooltip
   icon or tooltip defintion components.
2. After the tooltip closes, focus should retain the user's point of regard and
   return to the element that invoked it. Note: This does not apply to the
   tooltip icon or tooltip defintion components where focus never leaves the
   element that invokes it.
3. The tooltip component's focus must not move outside the modal until it is
   closed. Note: This does not apply to the tooltip icon or tooltip defintion
   components, as noted above, focus never leaves the element that invokes it.
4. The tooltip component has the same accessibility considerations as outlined
   in the
   [modal component documentation](https://pages.github.ibm.com/IBMa/Carbon_Integration/Doc/Modal-doc.html).
5. For the tooltip icon and tooltip definition: Be sure the tooltip is

## Accessibility testing

Automated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been
performed on the tooltip React Carbon component.
[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues
have been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available
in the Carbon Component GitHub repository.
