Tree views make displaying and navigating hierarchical data easier for your user. The parent and child nodes are purposely designed to nest and be used to organize a variety of complex data sets.

## Overview

Many products must display large sets of data that their users navigate to complete tasks. The tree view organizes this data in parent and child nodes that follow conventional behaviors of data trees and file browsers in operating systems.

### When to use

Use the tree view to visualize and users to navigate up and down tree data structures. Compared to similar components like accordion, left nav, or data table, the tree view is better suited for navigating deeper hierarchical levels.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Characteristic of the tree view make it suited for navigating data structures and should not be used as the primary navigation in a product's UI. Instead, use the UI Shell left panel for product navigation. A combination of the [UI shell left panel](/components/UI-shell-left-panel/code) and the [breadcrumb component](/components/breadcrumb/code) can support an information architecture several levels deep.

</DoDontRow>

Do not use the tree view as a way to show and hide other UI elements or content. The aesthetics and functions of the tree view are intented to organize large groups of nested nodes and make navigating up and down data structures more efficient. Other components, like the [accordion](/components/accordion/code), are better suited for displaying different types of content.

### Tree view types

<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

| Type      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default   | For navigating a data structure using a 32px row height that has similar geometry to the UI shell left nav.                                                                  |
| Compact   | A more compact version of the tree view that uses a 24px row height. This gives a more condensed view of the data when it is more imporant to show more nodes on the screen. |
| With icon | For indicating the node type. This is useful when the node type can be known in the data and if there could be different types of data displayed in the tree.                |

## Formatting

### Anatomy

The tree view is represents a data structure by the nesting of parent and end nodes. Any item in a tree should

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Tree view anatomy](images/tree_anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. Open parent node
2. End node
3. Selected node
4. File type icon
5. Closed parent node

#### Parent node

A parent node is a node with nested children nodes. Children nodes can be other parent nodes or end node. If the data requires it, a parent may be selected independantly of being expanded.
Uses the caret.
faces right when closed and down when operating.
Most often represented with a folder icon.

#### End node

Most often the text is the file name itself.
