## Overview

Many products must display large sets of data that their users navigate to complete tasks. The tree view organizes this data in parent and child nodes that follow conventional behaviors of data trees and file browsers in operating systems.

### When to use

Use the tree view to visualize and users to navigate up and down tree data structures. Compared to similar components like accordion, left nav, or data table, the tree view is better suited for navigating deeper hierarchical levels.

Characteristic of the tree view make it suited for navigating data structures and should not be used as the primary navigation in a product's UI. Instead, use the UI Shell left panel for product navigation. A combination of the [UI shell left panel](/components/UI-shell-left-panel/code) and the [breadcrumb component](/components/breadcrumb/code) can support an information architecture several levels deep.

Do not use the tree view as a way to show and hide other UI elements or content. The aesthetics and functions of the tree view are intented to organize large groups of nested nodes and make navigating up and down data structures more efficient. Other components, like the [accordion](/components/accordion/code), are better suited for displaying different types of content.
