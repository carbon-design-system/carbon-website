## Carbon add-ons

Carbon add-ons contain components, tools, and guidance that extend Carbon for a
specific product or experience. Add-ons enable teams to create their own custom
patterns and components that follow Carbon's visual style and guidelines.

If your team is using Carbon and needs components specific to your product or
industry, you should create a Carbon add-on.

If you feel that your components and/or patterns could be used in other
products, we encourage you to [contribute](/contributing/overview) your work
back to Carbon.

### Private vs public

The Carbon Design System is an open-source project and we encourage teams using
Carbon Design System to stay open-source as well. If your product has privacy
constraints, there are options for creating an add-on repo under our GitHub
Enterprise account.

## Contributing to add-ons

Add-ons are generally easier to contribute to because they are not fully managed
by the Carbon team. For your add-on to be accepted, your components must meet
WCAG AA standards and include interaction states (hover, active, focus, and
disabled).

## Ownership and maintenance

If you build an add-on repo, it's your responsibility to maintain it. This
involves carrying over changes from the core Carbon repo, as well as making sure
it is using the latest major version of Carbon.
