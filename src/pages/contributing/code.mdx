## Step 1: Find a project to work on

New issues submitted by the community are initially triaged by Carbon team
members. Any issue that the Carbon team accepts, but can not fit in their
roadmap, is open for community contribution.

#### Volunteer for existing work

The best way to volunteer is to look through
[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+contribution%22)
labeled with `community contribution`. Any issue labeled with
`code contribution needed` is fair game! Put a comment in the issue saying you'd
like to help.

If you want to join an issue that is already assigned to someone or has a
specific milestone, please discuss with the assignee of the issue or with the
Carbon team to coordinate.

Issues labeled `good first issue` are great candidates to pick up if you are in
the code for the first time. The Carbon team is also happy to help you find a
get started. Just stop by our [office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or send
us a slack message.

#### Submit an idea

Have a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a
bug? First, be sure to look through the
[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make
sure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the
[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).
If you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let is know in your
issue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.

If you've submitted a GitHub issue and it has been labeled `proposal: accepted`,
you can volunteer to take on the work. Simply leave a comment in the GitHub
issue.

## Step 2: Set up your developer environment

[Follow these steps](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to install the tools, set up your environment, and learn how to make a pull
request. You can explore all the repositories in the Carbon Design system
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system), but you will likely be working
in one of the following:

- [Carbon website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/)
- [Carbon monorepo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon)
- [Carbon Angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/)
- [Carbon Vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/)
- [Carbon charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/)

If you need help troubleshooting, [reach out](/help/contact-us/) to the Carbon
team.

## Step 3: Refine the issue

Your dev environment is set up and you might be tempted to jump into coding.
Before you get started, we recommend you refine the issue by creating a rough
task list and posting it in the issue comments.

If you have trouble answering any of these questions, reach out to the Carbon
team and we will help you refine your issue:

- Am I clear on the scope of this work?
- Is this task list feasible for me to do?
- Should a designer get involved to do initial research or create a design spec?
- Do I need to collaborate with anyone else?

## Step 4: Iterate and get feedback

Most contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or
join [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Data
Viz Guild or office hours. In these sessions, it is common to share work in
progress and ask lots of questions. As you make progress, update your GitHub
issue.

Work that results in code will be reviewed directly in a pull request.
Maintainers will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking questions
and suggesting changes to be made before they merge your code. When you need to
make a change, commit and push to your branch normally. Once all revisions to
your pull request are complete, a maintainer will squash and merge your commits
for you.
