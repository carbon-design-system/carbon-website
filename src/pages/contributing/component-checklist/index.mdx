on a “definition of done” to ensure all components are being built with the same
quality and assurance.

## Definition of done

By aligning on the requirements of component stability, we can easily prioritize
a backlog of work, share the status of assets with contributors and better
differentiate when an asset is a component versus a pattern. We can also work
backward from this strict list of requirements to inform where a component
currently is in the
[Product Development Lifecycle](/contributing/product-development-lifecycle/)
(PDLC). With each phase, the component should progress in its completeness. Once
it has reached stable and all items in the following checklists have been
completed, then the component will be considered done.

Note: Although not all published assets currently meet these requirements,
moving forward, we’d like all new assets to adhere to them.

| Status              | PDLC Phase       | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Draft`             | Discovery        | Partially complete, ready for validation.                                            |
| `Preview candidate` | Discovery        | Partially complete, with measurable results, stakeholders, and clear business value. |
| `Preview`           | Delivery         | Mostly complete, changes possible based on feedback, available to use in production. |
| `Stable`            | Launch and scale | Complete across code, kit, docs, design, and ready for production use.               |

## Design spec

The design specification (spec) is the blueprint used by developers to build the
component in code and for designers making the component in Figma. It is
referenced as the source of truth for the visual appearance and functionality of
a component. Having an accurate and detailed design spec ensures the component
will be built and represented consistently across experiences.

## Code

In order for code to be stable, it must meet the requirements in the table
below. Preview code should plan for these requirements, but does not need to
meet them in the discovery or delivery phases. For additional guidance how we
prefer to write code for the Carbon Design System, see the
[Carbon Style Guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/style.md).

### Testing

A crucial aspect to ensure continued quality of production stable code is
testing. The following testing requirements must be met before a component can
be considered stable.

## Documentation

All components and patterns require usage, style, code, and accessibility
guidance published on a Carbon ecosystem website. Carbon provides documentation
templates to help ensure visual and content expectations. Additional guidance on
creating layouts and images for website documentation can be found in the
[image production guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/design-resources/#image-production-guidelines).

| **IBM Figma Guidelines**        | Figma components follow the guidelines as defined in [IBM Figma Best Practices](https://www.figma.com/design/4UYvy6eey28bD3IvtNF8xP/IBM-Documentation-Library?node-id=654-4435&t=67lxOP8nwgq7z2E1-0). <br /> <br /> The guidance includes topics on component properties, auto layout, styles, icons, item and base components, content, construction, and file organization. | This checklist ensures components are built correctly before merging into the main Figma branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **IBM Figma Naming Convention** | Figma components follow the component naming convention documented in [IBM Figma Best Practices](https://www.figma.com/design/4UYvy6eey28bD3IvtNF8xP/IBM%C2%AE-Documentation-Library?m=auto&node-id=642-4479&t=1rSjk0nlj8wBV9aK-1).                                                                                                                                           | The naming convention ensures that file architecture and component hierarchies are both standardized and intuitive for the user. <br /> <br /> With this method we are able to have hierarchy between the final components, their bases, and their pieces when we traverse through the assets/instance swapper panels while still being able to view the entire component name when searching. |
| **Built to spec**               | The Figma component should match the [design spec](/contributing/component-checklist/#design-spec) perfectly down to the pixel. Every interaction spec’d should be included in the Figma component.                                                                                                                                                                           | Thorough implementation with intense attention to detail is pivotal to maintaining pervasive design excellence within the system. This high bar of quality sets our system apart and drives adoption, user satisfaction, and overall outcomes.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Published to a library**      | A Figma component must be published to the appropriate IBM Figma library. Components built in the Carbon repo are published in [(V11) Carbon Design System](<https://www.figma.com/design/YAnB1jKx0yCUL29j6uSLpg/(v11)-Carbon-Design-System?m=auto>).                                                                                                                         | A published connected component ensures accurate use across products. It also allows for Figma analytics to understand adoption and usage better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
