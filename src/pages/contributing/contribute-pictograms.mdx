<PageDescription>

IBM's pictograms are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or
narratives. They can communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and
simplify complex ideas. They draw from details found in the Plex typeface and
work well in presentations and marketing communications.

## Producing a pictogram

Don't see the pictogram you need in the library? Make your own! Follow these
guidelines to ensure visual consistency and proper formatting.

- All pictograms should be unique and not redundant with any existing pictograms
  in the system. Look through the pictograms in the
  [Pictogram library](/guidelines/pictograms/library/) to ensure that your
  proposed new pictogram is not already represented.
- All pictograms should adhere to the
  [IBM Design Language visual style](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/pictograms/design).
- All pictograms should comply with IBM
  [accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).
- All pictograms should be usable across all supported platforms and devices.
- All pictograms should be understandable by a global audience of users,
  regardless of nationality or language.

## Producing an icon

- Create a 32 x 32 px artboard for each pictogram.
- 32 px pictograms should have 1 px padding.
- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to grid.
- Be aware of automatic alignments which can place vectors on uneven or half
  pixels.
- The pictogram should be on the top-most layer in your artboard. Strokes should
  be grouped appropriately.
- Make sure to properly name layers and artboards (these names will also be
  exported into the code).

### Production-ready

- To be considered production-ready, all pictogram submissions must be delivered
  in Adobe Illustrator format at 32 x 32 px with strokes kept intact.
- Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid
  wherever possible.
- All strokes should be kept as is and not converted to shapes.
- Group strokes logically whenever possible.

## Export SVGs from Adobe Illustrator

1. Draw a 32 x 32 px artboard. 32 px pictograms should have 1 px padding.
1. Place the icon squarely on the artboard, making sure it's aligned to the
   pixel grid.
1. Expand all strokes `Object > Expand`.
1. Select all overlapping shapes and click the `Unite` icon in the `Pathfinder`
   panel to merge all of the shapes together.
1. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.
1. Select `File > Save a Copy…` from the top navigation.
1. On the `Format` dropdown select `SVG`.
1. Below `Format` select `Use Artboard`, then select either all or a range of
   artboards, depending on your need.
1. Click `Save`.
1. The `SVG Options` dialog will then open.
1. Make sure the preferences are the same as in the image below.

## Contribution process

Does your pictogram have potential for other materials at IBM? If so, please
consider contributing to the design system. IBM welcomes pictogram contributions
in the form of a pull request to our pictogram repository. For now, to make a
pull request,
**[please submit an issue in the repo](https://github.ibm.com/brand/Pictograms/issues/new/choose)**
with the pictogram attached.

Please note that Carbon contribution is not required in order to introduce a new
pictogram into your materials. If your pictogram is determined to be broadly
useful in Carbon and passes IBM Brand design reviews, then it may also be
integrated into the design system.

If your submission is accepted, the team will notify you. If changes are needed,
you'll need to create a new contribution issue after reworking it based on
feedback from the Design System and Brand teams.
