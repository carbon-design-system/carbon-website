## Step 1: Find a project

New issues submitted by the community are initially triaged by Carbon team
members. Any issue that the Carbon team accepts, but can not fit in their
roadmap, is open for community contribution.

#### Volunteer for existing work

The best way to volunteer is to look through
[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)
labeled with `needs: community contribution`. Any issue labeled with
`needs: design contribution` is fair game! Put a comment in the issue saying
you'd like to help.

The most common design requests are related to feature enhancements: researching
UX, creating visual solutions, and crafting a design spec are often required
before a feature enhancement can be put into code.

If you want to join an issue that is already assigned to someone or has a
specific milestone, please discuss with the assignee of the issue or with the
Carbon team to coordinate. Often contributors work in groups of 2-3.

We also have many ongoing projects to create and update reusable components in
Figma. This work is not currently tracked in GitHub, so check out the
[status of design kits](https://www.figma.com/file/CFMtqV5Nztdbm0mi2UiDLg/Library-%2B-Template-Planning?type=design&node-id=3713-26762&mode=design&t=HqvAYXUeccKNMstT-0)
and get involved by reaching out to the contacts listed.

The Carbon team is also happy to help you. Just stop by our
[Carbon Design office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or
[contact us](/help/contact-us/) directly.

#### Submit an idea

Have a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a
bug? First, be sure to look through the
[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make
sure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the
[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).
If you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let us know in your
issue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.

## Step 2: Refine the issue

Whereas code contributions tend to be well defined, design contributions can be
a little more ambiguous. We recommend you try writing a rough task list of what
you believe your contribution will entail, and post it in the GitHub issue
comments. In most cases, we recommend you then reach out to the Carbon team or
come to Carbon Design office hours. We'll help you further refine your issue,
clarify the scope of work, and connect you to other collaborators. Some good
questions to ask yourself are:

- Am I clear on the scope of this work?
- Is this task list feasible for me to do?
- Do I need to collaborate with anyone else?
- Do I have a clear definition of done or a plan to pass this to a developer?

## Step 3: Get feedback

Most contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or
join [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Data
Viz Guild or Carbon Design office hours. In these sessions, it is common to
share work in progress and ask lots of questions. In return, you'll get candid
feedback and help. As you make progress, update your GitHub issue.
