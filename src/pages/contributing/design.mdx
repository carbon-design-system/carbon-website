Design contributions can involve anything from creating design specs for feature
requests to mainting Figma libraries. Below you'll find tips and best practices
to get started.

## Step 1: Find a project to work on

New issues submitted by the community are initially triaged by Carbon team
members. Any issue that the Carbon team accepts, but can not fit in their
roadmap, is open for community contribution.

#### Volunteer for existing work

The best way to volunteer is to look through
[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)
labeled with `community contribution`. Any issue labeled with
`design contribution needed` is fair game! Put a comment in the issue saying
you'd like to help.

The most common design requests are related to feature enhancements: researching
UX, creating visual solutions, and crafting a design spec are often required
before a feature enhancement can be put into code.

If you want to join an issue that is already assigned to someone or has a
specific milestone, please discuss with the assignee of the issue or with the
Carbo team to coordinate. Often contributors work in groups of 2-3.

We also have many ongoing projects to create and update reusable components in
Figma. This work is not currently tracked in GitHub, so check out the
[status of design kits](https://www.figma.com/file/CFMtqV5Nztdbm0mi2UiDLg/Library-%2B-Template-Planning?type=design&node-id=3713-26762&mode=design&t=HqvAYXUeccKNMstT-0)
and get involved by reaching out to the contacts listed.

The Carbon team is also happy to help you find a get started. Just stop by our
[office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or send us a slack message.

#### Submit an idea

Have a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a
bug? First, be sure to look through the
[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make
sure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the
[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).
If you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let is know in your
issue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.

If you've submitted a GitHub issue and it has been labeled `proposal: accepted`,
you can volunteer to take on the work. Simply leave a comment in the GitHub
issue.

## Step 2: Refine the issue

Whereas code contributions tend to be well defined, design contributions can be
a little more ambiguous. We recommend you try writing a rough task list of what
you believe your contribution will entail, and post it in the GitHub issue
comments. In most cases, we recommend you then reach out to the Carbon team or
come to office hours. We'll help you further refine your issue, clarify the
scope of work, and connect you to other collaborators. Some good questions to
ask yourself are:

- Am I clear on the scope of this work?
- Is this task list feasible for me to do?
- Do I need to collaborate with anyone else?
- Do I have a clear definition of done or plan to pass this to a developer?

## Step 3: Iterate and get feedback

Most contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or
join [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Data
Viz Guild or office hours. In these sessions, it is common to share work in
progress and ask lots of questions. As you make progress, update your GitHub
issue.

Bring any work-in-progress to the following guilds and meet-ups. Here you'll get
candid feedback and helpâ€”we all want to see your design deliverable published!

### DSAG - Design System Adoption Guild

This is an expansive group of designers and developers all aligned on the
mission of delivering amazing experiences in the IBM Products organization. You
can learn more about the guild here.

### CAG - Carbon Accessibility Guild.

A once a sprint meeting where the Carbon team gets together with the
Accessibility team. Our components and patterns are reviewed and made more
accessible.

### Data Viz Guild

Description

### Design Crit

A once a sprint meeting led by Carbon designers to review patterns and artifacts
with the intent of eliciting feedback.

### Office Hours
