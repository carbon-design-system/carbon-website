## Documenting components

The website is written in markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute
content in a systematic way. Some components require more complex documentation
than others, but you should cover each topic included in the following markdown
templates: usage, style, code, and accessibility.

Check out Carbon's handy markdown
[styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet)
for how to style content. You may also use the
[Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/XQqHxu38CiY3Vx1iHdafIa/Image-production-guidelines?type=design&node-id=2651-218&mode=design&t=UbKwOlVeoU83hyGI-0)
to draft content and images

### Usage template: for components with one variant

The usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. The
template below provides example content from the
[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) usage tab, along with many tips on best
ways to compose content and images. Check out
[Content switcher](/components/content-switcher/usage) or
[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage) for additional single variant references.

```markdown

title: Accordion
description:
  An accordion is a vertically stacked list of headers that reveal or hide
  associated sections of content.
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

import A11yStatus from 'components/A11yStatus';

<!-- The page description should be the same as the component description, and no more than two sentences. Its purpose is to help readers quickly determine the general application of a component. More detailed information may be placed in the overview. -->

## Live demo

<!--
Since there is only one variant, the Accordion is labeled as 'Default' and no more variants are listed.
-->

<StorybookDemo themeSelector url="https://react.carbondesignsystem.com"
variants={[ { label: 'Default', variant: 'components-accordion--default', }, ]}
/>

<!--
Since there is only one variant for the A11yStatus section, the only component listed is 'Accordion.'
-->

<A11yStatus layout="cards" components="Accordion" />

## Overview

<!--
Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve specific tasks.
-->

The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space
through progressive disclosure. The header title gives the user a high level
overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.

Accordions can make information processing and discovering more effective.
However, it does hide content from users and it's important to account for a
user not noticing or reading all of the included content.

<!--
Overview image: Include an image that represents how the component is most often used in a product UI. The goal here is to show the component in context, rather than duplicating the Live Demo. Usually, this image is 8 columns, but in cases where the UI requires more space, 12 columns is permissible such as in [content switcher](/content-switcher/usage/#overview).
-->

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion grid placement](images/accordion-placement-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### When to use

<!--
Include examples of when to use this component and how it helps a user accomplish a task. You may write this section as a list as shown in the accordion example, or in 1-2 sentences as shown in the dropdown example.
-->

Example: Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side
panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It
is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.

- To organize related information.
- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when content is not crucial to read in
  full.
- When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once,
  like on a mobile interface or in a side panel.

  ### When not to use

<!--
If there are two seemingly similar components that should be used in distinctly different use cases, explain this distinction here. You may write this section as a list or in 1-2 sentences.
-->

Example:

It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to
choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.

- When organizing large amounts of information that can be nested, consider
  using [tree view](/components/tree-view/usage) instead.
- If a user is likely to read all of the content, then don't use an accordion as
  it adds the burden of an extra click; instead use a full scrolling page with
  normal headers.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<!--
The anatomy section includes an image of the component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.

See [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an additional example.
-->

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion anatomy](images/accordion-anatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Header**: contains the section title and is control for revealing the
   panel.
2. **Icon**: indicates if the panel is open or closed.
3. **Panel**: the section of content associated with an accordion header.

### Styling (optional)

<!--
Add this section if a component has different visual stylings but still shares the same functionality. For instance, form inputs usually have a default and fluid style. While the functionality stays the same, the visual appearance changes.

Provide a brief description of what the different styles are. Beneath the description, include a table detailing the style, appearance, and use case of each style. Then, add an image below the table to show the visual difference.
-->

Example:

There are two styles of number inputs: default and fluid. They share the same
functionality but look visually different, influencing where to use them.

| Style   | Appearance                                                                                                               | Use case                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default | A traditional style where the label is positioned outside and above the input field.                                     | Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |
| Fluid   | An alternative style where the label is placed inside of the input field and is stacked inline with the user input text. | Use in expressive moments, fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar.                                     |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![A default style input is shown on the left and fluid style is on the right.](images/number-input-usage-11.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>
  A default style input is shown on the left and fluid style is on the right.
</Caption>

### Sizing (optional)

<!--
List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.
-->

Example:

There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size
that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short
messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex
components, like data table the default or large modal will be more
accommodating.

### Alignment (optional)

<!--
The alignment section focuses primarily on padding and alignment within the component. This is sometimes confused with the placement section, which focuses on where the component is typically placed within the broader context of the page layout (such as in a side panel or modal).

In the accordion example below, there are H4 headers for Flush alignment and Icon alignment. These headers will vary from component to component.
-->

#### Flush alignment

Use flush alignment when designing within smaller spaces on a page such as side
panels or sidebars to achieve better text alignment with other content. Flush
alignment is also used to help avoid converging rule lines between components
that are close to each other on a page.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion flush alignment](images/accordion-flush.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Flush alignment places the row title and chevron icons with 0px padding, keeping
them flush to the rule dividers. For hover and focus interactive states, the
left and right padding receives an additional 16px padding.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion flush alignment spec](images/accordion-flush-spec.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Icon alignment

By default the chevron icon is placed on the `end` side of the header. This
allows for the title on the `start` side to align with other type elements in
the layout, which is the preferred alignment scenario.

However, in some rare scenarios, the accordion may be modified to place the icon
in `start` front of the title to function more like a tree. Most instances
should use the default `end` alignment, especially for any pure content or
documentation purposes. Icon placement in accordions should be consistent
throughout your page and should not alternate.

<!--
A Do/Don’t image is often useful for the alignment section. In the accordion example, two ‘Do’ images are provided.
-->

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont
type="do"
colMd={4} colLg={4}
caption="In most cases, use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.">

![Do use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.](./images/accordion-alignment-do.png)

</DoDont>
<DoDont
type="do"
colMd={4} colLg={4}
caption="In rare cases, you can place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.">

![Do place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.](./images/accordion-alignment-do-2.png)

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Placement

<!--
The placement section focuses on where the component is typically placed within the broader context of the page layout.

Start with an explanation on where it is typically placed in product UIs: main page content, a container, side panel, modal, etc. If placement impacts the component margins be sure to note this as well.
-->

Example: Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a
container such as a side panel or tile.

<!--
Including placement images helps readers understand how a component should appear in main body content, a side panel, a modal, etc.

Tips:
- Create simplified illustrations of placement examples using the illustration library.
- Try for 1, 2, or 4 examples. If you only have 3 examples, keep the images on a 2x2 grid and leave the 4th quadrant empty.
-->

<Row>
<Column colLg={12} colMd={12} colSm={4}>
<ArtDirection>

![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2m.png)

![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)

![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)

</ArtDirection>
</Column>
</Row>

<!--
Optional: You may add additional H4 sections to discuss how a component appears alongside other components, groups of the same component, and within the grid.
-->

#### Grid placement

When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid with its default alignment, the
indented title and content align to the grid columns, and the top and bottom
borders hang into the gutter. However, the accordion can be modified to have a
[flush alignment](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#alignment)
where the titles and content are instead flush aligned with the top and bottom
borders having 0px padding.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion grid placement](images/accordion-placement-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Content

### Main elements

<!--
Identify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.

Briefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.

See [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for additional examples.
-->

#### Label

- The label should be as brief as possible while still being clear and
  descriptive.
- Each label should be wrapped in a
  [role heading](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties)
  (h1-h6) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.

#### Body copy

- Content inside of a section may be split into paragraphs and include
  sub-headers if needed.

### Overflow content

<!--
Explain how overflow content should be handled.
-->

When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion
should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual
panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.

### Further guidance

<!--
This section should be the same in every component usage page.
-->

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](<[https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)>).

## Behaviors

### States

<!--
The states section is one of the most complex and varied sections, but here are a few tips:

- Make a distinction between main states (i.e. collapsed and expanded) and interactive states (i.e. focus, hover, and disabled).
- Include a table that describes the user tasks associated with each state. Do not italicize states in the table.
- When possible, include images showing the states, with captions. However, avoid overwhelming the reader with too many images, which can happen when the states section is complex or there are variants.
- Link out to style tab for more details with the phrase ‘See the style tab for more details.’

Take a look at [content switcher](/components/content-switcher/usage/#behaviors), our most recent, best example:
-->

### States

Content switcher's default-enabled state includes two types—**selected** and
**unselected** with the selected state using a high contrast color. Other
interactive states are **hover**, **focus**, and **disabled**. Learn more about
states on the
[Style](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/style) tab.

| State      | When to use                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unselected | When the first content tab is automatically selected.                                                                                                                        |
| Selected   | When the content tab(s) after the first one is unselected.                                                                                                                   |
| Hover      | When the user hovers the cursor over an unselected content tab.                                                                                                              |
| Focus      | When the user presses the right or left arrow, or clicks on the content tab, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the targeted content tab. |
| Disabled   | When a user cannot interact with the entire content switcher or a content tab. The entire content switcher or the content tabs could be temporarily inactive or unavailable. |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Selected and unselected content switcher states.](images/contentswitcher-usage-4.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<Caption>
  Example shows selected and unselected content switcher states.
</Caption>

For detailed visual information about the various interactive states for this
component, see the [Style](/components/content-switcher/style) tab.

The accordion component has two main states: **collapsed** and **expanded**. The
chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is
in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.

Accordions begin by default in the collapsed state with all content panels
closed. Starting in a collapsed state gives the user a high level overview of
the available information.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion states](images/accordion-state-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

A user can then independently expand each section of the accordion allowing for
multiple sections to be open at once.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![multiple sections expanded](images/accordion-state-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

In addition to the collapsed and expanded states, accordions also have
interactive states for focus, hover, and disabled. See the
[style tab](/components/accordion/style) for more details.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion interactives states](images/accordion-state-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Interactions

<!--
Include all possible interactions with the component, including:

- Mouse
- Keyboard
-->

#### Mouse

Users can trigger a state change by clicking on the chevron or clicking anywhere
in the header area.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![accordion click targets](images/accordion-click-target.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Keyboard

Users can navigate between accordion headers by pressing `Tab` or `Shift-Tab`.
Users can trigger a state change by pressing `Enter` or `Space` while the header
area has focus. For additional keyboard interactions, see the
[accessibility tab](/components/accordion/accessibility#keyboard-interactions).

### Validation

<!--
Include any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.
-->

### Responsive behavior

<!--
Include details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.
-->

### Default selection

<!--
Cover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.
-->

### Clickable areas

<!--
Provide details about the clickable areas of the component.
-->

### Loading

<!--
If applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).
-->

## Modifiers (optional)

<!--
The modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. The most common modifiers documented here are adding icons and dividers to a component.

Icon examples:
- [Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#buttons-with-icons)
- [Content switcher](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/#content-switcher-with-icons)
- [Tabs](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/usage/#tabs-with-icons)

Divider examples:
- [Contained list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/contained-list/usage/#inset-row-dividers)
- [Menu](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/menu/usage/#modifiers)

Accordion does not have modifiers. Below is an example from content switcher.
-->

### Content switcher with icons

Use icons instead of label text to indicate alternative views of similar or
related content. Icon content switchers are often used when space is limited or
when icons can adequately describe the sections (for example, a list view versus
a card view).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example shows the content switcher with icons only](images/content-switcher-icon.png)

</Column>
</Row>

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do use consistent icon or text content tabs">

![Do use consistent icon or text content tabs](images/content-switcher-usage-modifier-do.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" caption="Do not mix icon and text content tabs">

![Do not mix icon and text content tabs](images/content-switcher-usage-modifier-dont.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

## AI presence (optional)

<!--
Add this section if the component has a modification that takes on the AI visual styling when the AI label is present.

Provide a brief description of what the AI visual styling modifications are.

Beneath the description, include an image to show the visual. Beneath the description, include an image to show the visual. In some cases, you may need to add the tab image component if it has additional styling, for example, default and fluid styles.
-->

Example:

Number input has a modification that takes on the AI visual styling when the AI
label is present in the input. The AI variant of number input functions the same
as the normal version except with the addition of the AI label which is both a
visual indicator and the trigger for the explainability popover.

For more information on designing for AI, see the
[Carbon for AI guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default number input AI presence example](images/number-input-style-ai-default.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid number input AI presence example](images/number-input-style-ai-fluid.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

### Revert to AI

<!--
Provide a brief description of the "revert to AI" functionality after you have overridden the AI-suggested content of the component.

Beneath the description, include an image to show the visual. In some cases, you may need to add the tab image component if it has additional styling, for example, default and fluid styles.
-->

Example:

A number input can toggle between the AI variant and the non-AI variant
depending on the user’s interaction. If the user manually overrides the
AI-suggested content then the input will change from the AI variant to the
non-AI variant. Once edited, the user should still be able to switch back to the
initially AI generated content via a revert to AI button.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default number input AI revert example](images/number-input-usage-13.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

</Column>
</Row>

## Related

<!--
List all components or patterns you referenced throughout the docs page here and explain why these components are related. For example, if you provide alternative components, explain how their usage differs. Some of this content may be similar to the 'What not to use' section.
-->

The following components are additional ways to organize content. Consider the
type and length of content you are working with when choosing a content
container. Longer form content may benefit from tabs or a content switcher while
very short content might do better in a structured list.

- [Content switchers](/components/content-switcher/usage) allow users to toggle
  between two or more content sections within the same space on the screen.
- [Progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage) guide users
  through any linear, multistep task by showing the user their completed,
  current, and future steps.
- [Structured lists](/components/structured-list/usage) group content that is
  similar or related, such as terms and definitions.
- [Tabs](/components/tabs/usage) organize related content by allowing the user
  to navigate between groups of information that appear within the same context.
- [Tree view](/components/tree-view/usage) is a hierarchical structure that
  provides nested levels of navigation.

### Usage template: for components with multiple variants

Use this template for documenting components that have multiple variants. You
can see this template in use for
[Dropdown](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/),
[Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/), and
[Notification](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/).

Follow this template when possible; however, for components with more complex
variants, it may be necessary to adapt the structure to more effectively
organize and group variant content. See the
[Tile](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tile/usage/) component for an
example of this approach.

## Live demo

<!--
Include live demo here.
-->

### Accessibility testing status

<!--
Include the four resource cards here.
-->

## Overview

<!--
Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.

Do not directly copy the "Page Description" in this section.
-->

### When to use

<!--
Include examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.
-->

_Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from
continuing a user-initiated process._

### When not to use (optional)

<!--
If there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.
-->

Example: _Consider using a select dropdown if most of your experience is form
based or frequently used on mobile platforms. The native select works more
easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a
mobile platform._

### Variants

<!--
Variants are defined as variations of a component with significant visual or interaction differences, such as a primary button versus a secondary button or a ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as optional decorative icons, should be placed under the "Modifiers" section.

Include a table with variants of components and their purpose. Include links on the variant names to the variants sections below. See the [Modal](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#modal-variants) component for an example.

Do link each variant name in the table to its respective H2 section on the page. Do not italicize or semi-bold the variant name in the table.
-->

### Feature flags (optional)

<!--
This section is only applicable to components that have visual feature flags. See the [Tile](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tile/usage/#feature-flags) and [Structured list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/usage/#feature-flags) components feature flag sections for an example.

If displaying this section, remember to add a blue tag at the top of the Usage tab above the page description that says "Feature flag".

Include a brief description of feature flags, link to the components Code tab for code-specific information, and list out the main specific feature flags that are available for the component.

Include the tab image component to display the visual difference when the flag is enabled or disabled.
-->

Example:

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>
<Tabs>

<Tab label="Flag enabled">

![Interactive tiles with the feature flag enabled](images/tile-usage-feature-flag-enabled.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Flag disabled">

![Interactive tiles with the feature flag disabled](images/tile-usage-feature-flag-disabled.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<!--
The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in semi-bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.

See the [Contained list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/contained-list/usage/#anatomy) component for an example.
-->

### Styling (optional)

<!--
Add this section if a component has different visual stylings but still shares the same functionality. For instance, form inputs usually have a default and fluid style. While the functionality stays the same, the visual appearance changes.

Provide a brief description of what the different styles are. Beneath the description, include a table detailing the style, appearance, and use case of each style. Then, add an image below the table to show the visual difference.

Note: It may vary where to place this section depending on the complexity of the content. Place this section underneath the Formatting H2 following the Anatomy H3 if possible. However, if it makes more sense to do so, place this section under the component variant H2.
-->

Example:

There are two styles of text inputs: default and fluid. They share the same
functionality but look visually different, influencing where to use them.

| Style   | Appearance                                                                                                               | Use case                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default | A traditional style where the label is positioned outside and above the input field.                                     | Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |
| Fluid   | An alternative style where the label is placed inside of the input field and is stacked inline with the user input text. | Use in expressive moments, fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar.                                     |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![Default text input in the default style](images/text-input-text-default-style.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Fluid">

![Fluid text input in the fluid style](images/text-input-text-fluid-style.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

### Sizing (optional)

<!--
List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. We typically semi-bold the individual sizes in the sentence. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.
-->

Example:

There are four responsive modal sizes: **xs**, **small**, **default**, and
**large**. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you
have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long
single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal
will be more accommodating.

### Alignment (optional)

<!--
Consider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:

- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?
- Notifications—how do they stack?
- Button—what happens when there's more than one?

Alignment content is covered in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.
-->

Example:

Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right.
However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal
window.

### Placement

<!--
Discuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:

- alongside other components
- within the grid

You may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.
-->

Example:

The checkbox component is often used in forms. Forms can be placed on a full
page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to
terms and conditions or to filter information.

## Content

### Main elements

<!--
Identify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, body copy, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.

Briefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, recommended action labels.

See the [Checkbox](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage/#content) and [Modal](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#content) components for examples.
-->

### Overflow content (optional)

<!--
Explain how overflow content should be handled.
-->

Example:

When the modal content is longer than the modal height then the body section
should scroll vertically with the header and footer remaining fixed in place.
The content should visibly fade at the end of the modal body area to indicate
there is additional content out of view.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/).

## Universal behaviors

<!--
If there are any *universal* behaviors that apply to all variants listed in the variants table above, include them here. For example, the modal component has a heading here for "Trap focus" as this applies to all modal variants.

Where behaviors are *unique* to each component variant, include them in the next section, which goes into detail about each variant.

Include the following line to introduce the universal behaviors:
-->

Example:

The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the variants.
For behaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant
sections below.

<!--
Choose from this list of possible behaviors that are *universal* across all variants, and include them here as H3 headings.
-->

### States

<!--
If there are states associated with a component, include them here in a sentence. Do semi-bold each state in the sentence. Include a table below the sentence with each component state and when to use them. Do not italicize or semi-bold the state name in the table. Do not include an image here; instead, link to the Style tab for more information.
-->

Example:

The accordion component has two main states: **collapsed** and **expanded**. The
chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is
in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.
For more For detailed visual information about the various states for this
component, see the
[Style](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style/#interactive-states)
tab.

<!--
The word "Style" should be hyperlinked and capitalized, because it is the name of the tab page.
-->

### Interactions

<!--
Include all possible interactions with the component, including:

- Mouse
- Keyboard

See the [Content switcher](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/#interactions) component for an example.
-->

### Validation (optional)

<!--
Include any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See the [Text input](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/usage/#validation) component for an example.
-->

### Responsive behavior

<!--
Include details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.
-->

### Default selection (optional)

<!--
Cover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See the [Form](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) for an example.
-->

### Clickable areas

<!--
Provide details about the clickable areas of the component.
-->

### Loading (optional)

<!--
If applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading variant in the [Loading component](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/usage/) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).
-->

## Component variant name

<!--
Rename this H2 heading with the first component variant name, and include as many H2 sections as you have variants.

This section describes each of the component variants listed in the "Variants" table in the "Overview" section, and highlights any behavior that is *unique* to the component variant. Cover the topics from the "Universal behaviors" section above, as needed.

And again, if any behavior is *universal* to the component, cover that in the "Universal behaviors" section above.

For examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see the [Dropdown](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/#dropdown) component.
-->

## Modifiers

<!--
The modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:

- adding a non-interactive icon to a [Contained list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/contained-list/usage/#non-interactive-icons)
- adding dividers to a [Menu](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/menu/usage/#modifiers)
- styling a [Dropdown](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/#modifiers) to appear inline with other content
- using high and low contrast styles for [Notifications](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)
-->

## AI presence (optional)

<!--
Add this section if the component has a modification that takes on the AI visual styling when the AI label is present.

Provide a brief description of what the AI visual styling modifications are.

Beneath the description, include an image to show the visual. In some cases, you may need to add the tab image component if it has additional styling, for example, default and fluid styles.
-->

Example:

Text input and text area have a modification that takes on the AI visual styling
when the AI label is present in the input. The AI variant functions the same as
the normal version except with the addition of the AI label which is both a
visual indicator and the trigger for the explainability popover.

For more information on designing for AI, see the
[Carbon for AI](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/)
guidelines.

### Revert to AI

<!--
Provide a brief description of the "revert to AI" functionality after you have overridden the AI-suggested content of the component.

Beneath the description, include an image to show the visual. In some cases, you may need to add the tab image component if it has additional styling, for example, default and fluid styles.
-->

Example:

The text input and text area can toggle between the AI variant and the non-AI
variant depending on the user’s interaction. If the user manually overrides the
AI-suggested content then the input will change from the AI variant to the
non-AI variant. Once edited, the user should still be able to switch back to the
initially AI generated content via a revert to AI button.

### Style template: for components with one variant

The style template helps describe how a component with one variant looks,
including visual specifications such as color, typography, structure, and size.
The template below provides example content from the
[Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style) style
tab, along with many tips on best ways to compose content and images.

```markdown
---
title: [Component name]
description: [Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.]
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

<PageDescription>

The following page documents visual specifications such as color, typography,
structure, and size.

## Color

<!--
**Table**
Use the table to document properties and color tokens for the enabled state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

**Image**
Add an image that shows the enabled state of the component.

The following table shows an example from [Checkbox](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/style#color).
-->

| Element            | Property         | Color token       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Group label        | text color       | `$text-secondary` |
| Checkbox label     | text color       | `$text-primary`   |
| Checkbox:unchecked | border           | `$icon-primary`   |
|                    | background-color | transparent       |
| Checkbox:checked   | background-color | `$icon-primary`   |
|                    | checkmark        | `$icon-inverse`   |
| Helper text        | text color       | `$text-secondary` |

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Checkbox states](images/checkbox-style-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Interactive state color

<!--
**Table**
Use the table to document properties and color tokens for interactive states. Begin the table with the State column, not the Element column; this helps users scan faster and better reference accompanying images, which are also organized by state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

**Image**
Add an image that shows all listed states in the table. The states are typically laid out in a grid.

The following table shows an example from [Checkbox](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/style#interactive-states).
-->

| State     | Element         | Property   | Color token        |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Focus     | Checkbox        | border     | `$focus`           |
| Disabled  | Label           | text color | `$text-disabled`   |
|           | Checkbox        | border     | `$icon-disabled`   |
|           |                 | background | `$icon-disabled`   |
| Read-only | Label           | text color | `$text-primary`    |
|           | Checkbox        | border     | `$icon-disabled`   |
|           |                 | inner fill | `$icon-primary`    |
| Error     | Label           | text color | `$text-primary`    |
|           | Checkbox        | border     | `$support-error`   |
|           | Error message   | text color | `$text-error`      |
|           | Error icon      | svg        | `$support-error`   |
| Warning   | Label           | text color | `$text-primary`    |
|           | Checkbox        | border     | `$icon-primary`    |
|           | Warning message | text color | `$text-primary`    |
|           | Warning icon    | svg        | `$support-warning` |
|           |                 | inner fill | `$black`           |

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Checkbox interactive states](images/checkbox-style-2.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Typography

<!--
Begin this section with any brief content guidelines. Link out to additional guidelines if needed. No images are required for this section.

*Table*
Use a table to document font-size, font-weight, and type tokens in this section. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

The following table shows an example from [Checkbox](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/style#typography).
-->

Checkbox labels and group labels should be sentence case, with only the first
word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized. Checkbox labels and group
labels should not exceed three words.

| Element         | Font-size (px/rem) | Font-weight   | Type token         |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Group label     | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$label-01`        |
| Checkbox label  | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-compact-01` |
| Helper text     | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$helper-text-01`  |
| Error message   | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$label-01`        |
| Warning message | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$label-01`        |

## Structure

<!--
*Table*
Begin the structure section with a table to document states, spacing, and any other component-specific configurations. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

*Images*
Add supporting images to this section, with at least one image showing structure and another showing spacing measurements. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.

*Modifiers*
If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed.

The following content shows example documentation from [Checkbox](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/style#structure), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.
-->

| Element        | Property       | px / rem | Spacing token |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Checkbox       | height & width | 16px     | –             |
|                | border         | 1px      | –             |
| Checkbox:focus | border         | 2px      | –             |
|                | border inset   | 1px      | –             |
| Group label    | margin-bottom  | 8 / 0.5  | `$spacing-03` |
| Checkbox label | padding-left   | 8 / 0.5  | `$spacing-03` |
| Checkbox item  | margin-bottom  | 4 / 0.25 | `$spacing-02` |

<div className="image--fixed">

## Size

<!--
**Body**
Using body copy below the header, cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.

*Table*
In the size section, provide a table of component size names and height.

**Image**
Each size listed in the table should be included in the image, typically stacked horizontally or vertically. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Size section to maintain size accuracy.

If a component does not have sizes (i.e. Checkbox) then you can skip this section. The following shows an example from [Tag](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tag/style#size).
-->

There are three tag sizes: small, medium, and large. See
[sizing](/components/tag/usage#sizing) on the usage tab for more information
about specific use cases for each tag size.

| Element   | Size        | Height (px/rem) |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Container | Small (sm)  | 18 / 1.125      |
|           | Medium (md) | 24 / 1.5        |
|           | Large (lg)  | 32 / 2          |

## AI presence

<!--
**Body**
Include any content to help define the scope of the AI style in the component. Then add a link to the Carbon for AI guidelines page so the user can learn more about the AI styling.

**Table**
Provide a table of any AI specific color tokens and elements used in the component. You do not need to repeat any tokens that are the same as the default version.

**Images**
Show the component with AI presence in an image. You only need to show the enabled and revert states.

The following content shows an example from (Checkbox)[https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/style#ai-presence]
-->

The only style modification an AI version of the checkbox has is the addition of
the slug. All other tokens in the component remain the same as the non-AI
variants.

For more information on the AI style elements, see the
[Carbon for AI](/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/) guidelines.

| Element | Property | Token / Size |
| ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| AI slug | size     | mini         |

### Style template: for components with multiple variants

This style template helps describe how a component with multiple variants look,
including visual specifications such as color, typography, structure, and size.
The template below provides example content from the
[Text input](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style) style
tab, along with many tips on best ways to compose content and images.

```markdown
---
title: [Component name]
description: [Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.]
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

<PageDescription>

The following page documents visual specifications such as color, typography,
structure, size, and AI presence.

</AnchorLinks>

## Color

<!--
The color section for components with multiple variants is subdivided by `H3` headings to create separate color specifications for each variant.
-->

### Variant 1 color

<!--
**Header**
In the h3 header, replace the text `Variant 1` with the variant’s name. For example: “Text input color.”

**Table**
Use the table to document properties and color tokens for the enabled state of the first variant. If a variant includes multiple styles (such as default and fluid) that share the same color tokens then those stylings can be presented together in the same table. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

**Images**
Add an image that shows the enabled state of the variant. If a variant includes multiple styles (such as default and fluid) that share the same color tokens, those stylings can be presented together as a tabbed or side-by-side image.

The following content is an example from text input: https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style#color
-->

| Element          | Property         | Color token         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Label            | text color       | `$text-secondary`   |
| Field text       | text color       | `$text-primary`     |
| Placeholder text | text color       | `$text-placeholder` |
| Helper text      | text color       | `$text-helper`      |
| Field            | background-color | `$field` \*         |
|                  | border-bottom    | `$border-strong` \* |

In the h4 header, replace the text `Variant 1` with the variant’s name. For example: “Text input interactive states color.”

**Table**
Use a table to document properties and color tokens for the interactive states of the first variant. This table will have four columns, beginning with the State column, not the Element column; this helps users scan faster and better reference accompanying images, which are also organized by state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

**Images**
Each state listed in the table should be included in the image, typically laid out in a gridded image.

## Typography

<!--
Typically, variants use similar type styling and can be grouped together in one table.  If the type is different across variants then subdivide this section with H3 for each variant.
-->

### Variant 1 typography

<!--
Begin this section with any brief content guidelines. Link out to additional guidelines if needed. No images are needed for this section.

**Table**
Use a table to document font-size, font-weight, and type tokens in this section. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

The following example is from [Text input](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style#typography).
-->

Text input labels and field text should be set in sentence case, with only the
first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized. See the text input
[content guidelines](/components/text-input/usage#content) for more details.

| Element                   | Font-size (px/rem) | Font-weight   | Type token         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Label                     | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$label-01`        |
| Field text                | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-compact-01` |
| Helper text               | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$helper-text-01`  |
| Error and warning message | 12 / 0.75          | Regular / 400 | `$label-01`        |

### Variant 2 typography

<!--
Use the same guidance as in the `Variant 1 typography` section.
-->

## Structure

<!--
The structure section for components with multiple variants is subdivided by `H3` headings to create separate specifications for each variant.
-->

### Variant 1 structure

<!--
**Header**
In the h3 header, replace the text `Variant 1` with the variant’s name. For example: “Text input structure.” When an additional categorization is needed, keep the variant name first, for example: "Text input fluid structure."

**Table**
Begin the first variant structure section with a table to document the padding, spacing, and measurements of the component, including any specifications related to states or other configurations. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

**Images**
Add supporting images under the table, with at least one image of the component that illustrates the spacing and measurements with annotations. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the table. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.
-->

| Element     | Property                    | px / rem | Spacing token |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Label       | margin-bottom               | 8 / 0.5  | `$spacing-03` |
| Helper text | margin-top                  | 4 / 0.25 | `$spacing-02` |
| Input text  | padding-left, padding-right | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |
| Field       | border-bottom               | 1px      | –             |
| Focus       | border                      | 2px      | –             |
| Error       | border                      | 2px      | –             |

</Caption>

#### Variant 1 modifier structure

<!--
Optional: Some variants may have modifiers that can change the structure of the component. Use an H4 section under the parent variant and create a separate table and image for the modifier. For an example see tabs: https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/style#line-tab-structure
-->

| Element      | Property      | px / rem | Spacing token |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |

## Size

<!--
The size section for components with multiple variants can be subdivided by `H3` headings to create separate specifications for each variant.
-->

### Variant 1 size

<!--
**Header**
In the h3 header, replace `Variant 1` with the second variant’s name. For example: “Text input sizes.”

**Body**
Using body copy below the header, cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.

**Table**
Provide a table of component size names and heights. If needed, you can add another column to clarify which component element is changing with the size.

**Image**
Each size listed in the table should be included in the image, typically stacked horizontally or vertically. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Size section to maintain size accuracy.

The following content shows an example from text input: https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style/#size.
-->

These following sizes apply only to the default style of text input. See
[sizing](/components/text-input/usage#sizing) on the Usage tab for more
information about specific use cases for each size.

| Element | Size        | Height (px / rem) |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Input   | Small (sm)  | 32 / 2            |
|         | Medium (md) | 40 / 2.5          |
|         | Large (lg)  | 48 / 3            |

<div className="image--fixed">

![Sizes for text input](images/text-input-style-size.png)

</div>

<Caption>Text input default style sizes | px / rem</Caption>

### Variant 2 size

<!--
Use the same guidance as in the `Variant 1 size` section.
-->

## AI presence

<!--
The AI presence section for components with multiple variants is typically combined into one section because the variants tend to share the same AI styling. If the AI styling is different across variants then subdivide this section with H3 for each AI variant.

**Body**
Include any content to help define the scope of the AI style in the component. Then add a link to the Carbon for AI guidelines page so the user can learn more about the AI styling.

**Table**
Provide a table of any AI specific color tokens and elements used in the component. You do not need to repeat any tokens that are the same as the default version.

**Images**
Show each variant that has an AI presence in a group or tabbed image.  You only need to show the enabled and revert states.

The following content shows an example from text input: https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style/#ai-presence.
-->

The following are the unique styles applied to the component when the AI slug is
present. Unless specified, all other tokens in the component remain the same as
the non-AI variant.

For more information on the AI style elements, see the
[Carbon for AI](/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/) guidelines.

| Element         | Property         | Token / Size        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Linear gradient | start            | `$ai-aura-start-sm` |
|                 | stop             | `$ai-aura-stop`     |
| Field           | border-bottom    | `$ai-border-strong` |
|                 | background color | `$field`\*          |

### Code template

The code template helps developers implement your component. Be specific,
include code snippets, and be sure to update as dependencies and versions
change.

```markdown
---
title: Component name (you won't need to write this)
description: Component description (you won't need to write this)
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

<PageDescription>

<!--
How to build a [component name] using React. For code usage with other
frameworks, please follow the links in the live demo on the usage tab.
-->

</PageDescription>

<AnchorLinks>

<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>[Component use-case]</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Component API</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>

</AnchorLinks>

## Overview

<!--
This should include the default use-case(s) for a component, at most 2.
This should be the most common way the component is used.
It should summarize what this common is for and provide snippets for how
to accomplish these common use-cases.

Example: You can build a breadcrumb using a combination of the Breadcrumb and BreadcrumbItem components. The Breadcrumb component accepts a list of BreadcrumbItem components as children and each BreadcrumbItem is responsible for displaying the page links in the hierarchy.
-->

### Skeleton

<!--
Include which component/s to use for the skeleton state and why it might be useful.

Example:

*You can use the BreadcrumbSkeleton component to render a skeleton variant of an breadcrumb. This is useful to display while content in your breadcrumb is being fetched from an external resource like an API.*
-->

## [Use case, for example, Skeleton state or Sorting]

<!--
Each use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,
if an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.

If the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like
how you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this
section.

This section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,
along with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.
-->

## Component API

### [Component name] props

| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |

<!--
* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that
* Specify the default value if applicable
* Provide a description if applicable
* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations
* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)
* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order
-->

#### [Component name][prop name]

### Accessibility template

The accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are
accessible. The published information helps users understand all the
accessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance
on creating the
[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).
Also check out Button's [Accessbility](/components/button/accessibility/) tab
for additional references.

```markdown
---
title: Component name (you won't need to write this)
description: Component description (you won't need to write this)
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

import A11yStatus from 'components/A11yStatus';

<PageDescription>

<!--
There are 2 stock page descriptions.
Choose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.
** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.

Example 1:
Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

Example 2:
No accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in
mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

<!--
This keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.

Example 1:
-->

Each accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse
accordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded
accordions integrate into the tab order automatically.

<!--
Example 2:
Each page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current
page, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button
for the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation
-->

<!--
**Images**
Use one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.
Normally these images go across 8 columns.
images should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png)
The ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.
The caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.
Example:
![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)
<Caption>
  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.
</Caption>
-->

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![example of (component_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)

<Caption>
  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<!--
The Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed
-->

## Design recommendations

Design annotations are needed for the following instances.

<!--
Some of the possible subheadings here include:
- headings
- alignment
- labeling
- meaningful order

Each should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.

Example:

### Headings
Carbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.

-->

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component:

<!--
Provide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to reference the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.

- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the
following symbols: <element>, 'variable' and "value".
- End each bulleted list item with a period.

Example:
- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.

<A11yStatus layout="table" components="Component name" />

-->
```

## Documenting patterns

Patterns show reusable combinations of components and templates that address
common user objectives with sequences and flows. Because they are more
complicated than components, you may need to adjust the topic order to best tell
the story — but your pattern should cover all of the topics outlined in the
following templates.

### Pattern template: for one variant

Use this template for documenting patterns that have a single variant. You can
see this template in use for [Toolbar](/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern/).

```markdown
---
title: Pattern name
description: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.
---

<PageDescription>

Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.

## Overview

This section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

For example, use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

Use the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.
Depending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these
headings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general "Designing
with [pattern]" heading. See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)
as an example.

### Types of [pattern]

If the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use
cases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.

See the
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)
pattern and the
[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
pattern for examples.

### Behaviors

Describe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states
and content.

### Best practices

Are there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.

For examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see
[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and
[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See the
[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
and the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)
for examples.

### Other use cases

If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here
with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for
using one solution over another.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)
and guidelines, and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

For examples, see the
[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)
and the
[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).

patterns? List them here.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.

## References

Help designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way
you implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles
that you found helpful.

## Feedback

### Pattern template: for multiple variants

Use this template for documenting patterns that have multiple types or variants.
You can see this template in use for [Dialog](/patterns/dialog-pattern/) and
[Loading](/patterns/loading-pattern/).

```markdown
---
title: Pattern name (multiple variants)
description: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.

## Overview

Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern
and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.

The purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.

### Anatomy

It can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.
See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)
and the
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
for examples of this visual treatment.

Alternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the
pattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with
callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### [Pattern] variants

Include a table with the variants discussed in this pattern. Include a short
description about the usage of each pattern variant. The table in
[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#variants)
is a good example of the level of detail required.

The variant names should link to the H2 headings for the variants below.

Add more columns, if needed. For example, you could add a column that includes
short explanations about when not to use the variant and guide the user to an
alternative that may be more appropriate.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section covers _universal_ content related to all variants, and depending
on the requirements of your pattern, may include the following H3s.

### When to use

If you need to elaborate on the content included in the pattern variants table
in the Overview, include that detail here. The
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#when-to-use)
is a good example of the kind of content to include.

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern and
provide alternatives.

### Universal behaviors

Describe any behaviors that are universal to all pattern variants, and include
guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
for an example.

### Other considerations

If there are any other considerations particular to your pattern that are
applicable to all variants, include them here.

## [Pattern] variant

Rename this H2 heading with the first pattern variant name, and repeat for all
variants within this pattern. These sections should map directly to the variant
table in the Overview.

This section describes the pattern variant in detail, and highlights content
that is _unique_ to the pattern variant. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

The H3s headings below are suggested that be included and adapted to suit the
requirements and complexity of the variant.

Include an introductory paragraph about the pattern variant to set context.

### [Pattern variant] anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern variant. See
the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Provide use cases and situations for when this pattern should be used.

### When not to use

If required, also include a "When not to use" section with details about when
not to use and suggest alternatives.

### Designing with [pattern variant]

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the variant in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

### [Pattern variant] behaviors

Describe behaviors specific to the pattern variant, including guidance on
interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's

and the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)
for examples.

### Other use cases

If there are similar use cases that may require a different solution, include
details here and explain the reasons for using one solution over another.

Repeat the H2 heading `Pattern variant` with the necessary H3 headings for each
variant within the pattern.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,
and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

## Writing better content

As you fill out the templates above, please keep these things in mind when
writing content for Carbon.

- Aim for a friendly and encouraging tone.
- Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun ("you").
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text,
  the easier it is for all users to understand.
- Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content
  switcher and Data table.

## Publishing updates

Ready to get your work reviewed and published? There are two ways to do this,
depending on your experience with GitHub. You may also draft your content and
bring it to
[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)
to get further guidance.

### Editing in browser

#### How to edit an existing page

If you are editing an existing docs page, the easiest option is to click on the
`Edit this page on GitHub` link that appears at the bottom of every page on the
site. The link opens the specific GitHub page where you can edit the content and
then propose the change with a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by
the Carbon team. This is the easiest and most commonly used approach by
contributors.

<Video
  src="/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.mp4"
  poster="/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.png">
  <track default srcLang="en" title="How to edit an existing page" />
</Video>

#### How to add a new page or image

To start, go to the Carbon website repository
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website). Navigate to the
left hand corner above the files and click `main`. From here, type in a new
branch name that reflects your work. For
example,`add-accordion-accessibility-guidance`. Once that new branch is created,
navigate to where the new file will be stored for a
[component](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/components)
or
[pattern](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/patterns).

Ensure you are in the branch you created, then navigate to `Add file` in the
upper right-hand corner. To add a new guidance page, click `create new file`
button. Title the file one of the following: `usage.mdx`, `style.mdx`,
`code.mdx`, or `accessibility.mdx`. To add an image, make sure you are in the
image folder and click `Upload files`.

After filling out the markdown template or adding an image, click
`Commit changes`. Describe your work and double check that you are on the branch
you created. If you are in the wrong branch, you will have to copy your content
into the correct branch.

<Video
  src="/videos/inline-edit-contribution.mp4"
  poster="/videos/inline-edit-contribution.png">
  <track default srcLang="en" title="How to add a new page or image" />
</Video>

Once you have committed your changes, go to the
[Pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/pulls)
page. Compare `base: main` to your branch and click `Create new pull request`.
Your contribution will be reviewed by the Carbon team!

### Editing in a local environment

Alternatively, if you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates
and are up for a more advanced option, you'll want to fork the repo and install
some of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier
workflow for you long term, but takes some time to set up.

If you are familiar with this process, you can
[fork the repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submission-guidelines)
and get started. Otherwise, reach out to the Carbon team on slack or
[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)
and we'll help you find the best way to contribute.
