## Documenting components

The website is written in markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute
content in a systematic way. Some components require more complex documentation
than others, but you should cover each topic included in the following markdown
templates: usage, style, code, and accessibility.

Check out Carbon's handy markdown
[styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet)
for how to style content.

### Usage template: for components with one variant

The usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. You
can see this template in use for components with only one variant:
[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and
[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).

```markdown

title: Component name
description: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']

## Overview

<!--
Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.

Example:

*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*
-->

### When to use

<!--
Include examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.

Example:

*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*
-->

### When not to use (optional)

<!--
If there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.

Example:

*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*
-->

## Live demo

<!--Include component demo here.-->

## Formatting

### Anatomy

<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.

See [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->

### Sizing (optional)

<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.

Example:

*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*
-->

### Alignment (optional)

<!--
Consider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:

- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?
- Notifications—how do they stack?
- Button—what happens when there's more than one?

We have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.

Example:

*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*
-->

### Placement

<!--
Discuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:

- alongside other components
- within the grid

You may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.

Example:

*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*
-->

## Content

### Main elements

<!--
Identify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.

Briefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.

See [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.
-->

### Overflow content

<!--
Explain how overflow content should be handled.

Example:

*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*
-->

### Further guidance

<!--
For further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).
-->

## Behaviors

<!--
Determine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.
-->

### States

<!--
If including any information on this topic, include the following line:

For detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.

Example:

*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*
-->

### Interactions

<!--
Include all possible interactions with the component, including:

- Mouse
- Keyboard
- Screen readers

See [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.
-->

### Validation

<!--
Include any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.
-->

### Responsive behavior

<!--
Include details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.
-->

### Default selection

<!--
Cover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.
-->

### Clickable areas

<!--
Provide details about the clickable areas of the component.
-->

### Loading

<!--
If applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).
-->

## Modifiers

<!--
The modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:

- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)
- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)
- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content
- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)
- using a "light" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)
-->

## Related

<!--
Did you reference other components or patterns? List them here.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.
-->

## References

<!--
Include any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.

### Usage template: for components with multiple variants

Use this template for documenting components that have multiple types or
variants. You can see this template in use for
[Dropdown](/components/dropdown/usage), [Modal](/components/modal/usage), and
[Notification](/components/notification/usage).

## Overview

<!--
Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.
-->

### When to use

<!--
Include examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.

*Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from continuing a user-initiated process.*
-->

### When not to use (optional)

<!--
If there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.

Example:

*Consider using a select dropdown if most of your experience is form based or frequently used on mobile platforms. The native select works more easily with a native form when submitting data and is also easier to use on a mobile platform.*
-->

### Types

<!--
Types are different variations of the component with significant visual or interaction differences, for example, primary button vs. secondary button vs. ghost button. Minor visual differences, such as button height, should be placed under modifiers.

Include a table with types of components and their purpose. Include links on the type names to the types sections below. See [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal) for an example.
-->

## Live demo

<!--
Include live demo here.
-->

## Formatting

<!--
### Anatomy

The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.

See [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.
-->

### Sizing (optional)

<!--
List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.

Example:

*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*
-->

### Alignment (optional)

<!--
Consider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:

- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?
- Notifications—how do they stack?
- Button—what happens when there's more than one?

Alignment content is covered in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.

Example:

*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*
-->

### Placement

<!--
Discuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:

- alongside other components
- within the grid

You may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.

Example:

*The checkbox component is often used in forms. Forms can be placed on a full page, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to terms and conditions or to filter information.*
-->

## Content

### Main elements

<!--
Identify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, body copy, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.

Briefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, recommended action labels.

See [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.
-->

### Overflow content (optional)

<!--
Explain how overflow content should be handled.

Example:

*When the modal content is longer than the modal height then the body section should scroll vertically with the header and footer remaining fixed in place. The content should visibly fade at the end of the modal body area to indicate there is additional content out of view.*
-->

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](<[https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)>).

## Universal behaviors

<!--
If there are any *universal* behaviors that apply to all types listed in the types table above, include them here. For example, the Modal component has a heading here for "Trap focus" as this applies to all modal types.

Where behaviors are *unique* to each type of component, include them in the next section which goes into detail about each type.

Include the following line to introduce the universal behaviors:

Example:

*The behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the types. For behaviors that are unique to each type, see each of the component type sections below.*

Choose from this list of possible behaviors that are *universal* across all types, and include them here as h3 headings.
-->

### States

<!--
If including any information on this topic, include the following line:

For detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.

Example:

*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*
-->

### Interactions

<!--
Include all possible interactions with the component, including:

- Mouse
- Keyboard
- Screen readers

See [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.
-->

### Validation

<!--
Include any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.
-->

### Responsive behavior

<!--
Include details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.
-->

### Default selection

<!--
Cover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.
-->

### Clickable areas

<!--
Provide details about the clickable areas of the component.
-->

### Loading

<!--
If applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).
-->

## Component type name

<!--
Rename this H2 heading with the first component type name, and include as many H2 sections as you have types.

This section describes each of the component types listed in the Types table in the Overview, and highlights any behavior that is *unique* to the component type. Cover the topics from Universal behaviors above, as needed.

And again, if any behavior is *universal* to the component, cover that in the "Universal behaviors" section above.

For examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see [Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).
-->

## Modifiers

<!--
The modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:

### Style template

The style template helps describe how a component looks, including visual
specifications such as color, typography, structure, and size.

```markdown
---
title: [Component name]
description: [Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.]
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

<PageDescription>

The following page documents visual specifications such as color, typography,
structure, and size.

<AnchorLinks>

<AnchorLink>Color</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Typography</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Structure</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Size</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>

</AnchorLinks>

## Color

<!--
Use a table to document properties and color tokens in this section. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

The following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).
-->

| Element | Property      | Color token        |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Title   | color         | `$text-primary`    |
| Content | color         | `$text-primary`    |
| Icon    | fill          | `$icon-primary`    |
| Header  | border-top    | `$border-subtle`\* |
|         | background    | Transparent        |
| Panel   | border-bottom | `$border-subtle`\* |
|         | background    | Transparent        |

<Caption>
  * Denotes a contextual color token that will change values based on the layer
  it is placed on.
</Caption>

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![enabled state](images/accordion-style-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Interactive state color

<!--
Use a table to document properties and color tokens for interactive states. Begin the table with the State column, not the Element column; this helps users scan faster and better reference accompanying images, which are also organized by state. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

You may also choose to include images or tabs to illustrate variants.

The following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).
-->

| State    | Element | Property   | Color token        |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Hover    | Header  | background | `$layer-hover`\*   |
| Focus    | Header  | border     | `$focus`           |
| Disabled | Header  | border-top | `$border-subtle`\* |
|          | Title   | background | `$text-disabled`   |
|          | Icon    | fill       | `$icon-disabled`   |

<Caption>
  * Denotes a contextual color token that will change values based on the layer
  it is placed on.
</Caption>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Default">

![default accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-2.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Flush">

![flush accordion alignment interactive states](images/accordion-style-3.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Column>
</Row>

## Typography

<!--
Begin this section with any brief content guidelines. Link out to additional guidelines if needed.

Then, use a table to document font-size, font-weight, and type tokens in this section. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

The following table shows an example from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style).
-->

All accordion titles are set in sentence case. See the accordion
[content guidelines](/components/accordion/usage#content) for more details.

| Element | Font-size (px/rem) | Font-weight   | Type token |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Title   | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |
| Content | 14 / 0.875         | Regular / 400 | `$body-01` |

## Structure

<!--
Begin the structure section with a table to document states, spacing, and any other component-specific configurations. You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.

Add supporting images to this section, with at least one image showing structure and another showing spacing measurements. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.

Variants: You may need to provide additional specs for component variants like default versus flush alignment. For each variant, make a new h3 section and give it a name. The following are example pairs of section headers:

Default style text area structure
Fluid style text area structure

Default style text input structure
Fluid style text input structure

Default alignment structure
Flush alignment structure

Modifiers: If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed. Here are some example cases where a modifier section has been added:

- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)
- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)
- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)

The following content shows example documentation from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.
-->

| Element | Property    | px/rem   | Spacing token |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Header  | height      | 40 / 2.5 | –             |
| Item    | border-top  | 1        | –             |
| Title   | margin-left | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |

<div className="image--fixed">

![Structure measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-4.png)

</div>

<Caption>
  Structure measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem
</Caption>

<br />

<div className="image--fixed">

![Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-5.png)

</div>

<Caption>
  Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem
</Caption>

## Size

<!--
In the size section, provide a table of component size names and height. Be sure to cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.

Example: The following table shows an example from [Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/style).
-->

There are six button sizes: small, medium, large productive, large expressive,
extra large, and 2XL. The large expressive button is used in editorial and
digital marketing experiences. See
[Button sizes](/components/button/usage#button-sizes) on the Usage tab for more
information about specific use cases for each button size.

| Variant           | Size             | Height (px / rem) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Button            | Small            | 32 / 2            |
|                   | Medium           | 40 / 2.5          |
|                   | Large productive | 48 / 3            |
|                   | Large expressive | 48 / 3            |
| Full bleed button | Extra large      | 64 / 4            |
|                   | 2xl              | 80 / 5            |

### Code template

The code template helps developers implement your component. Be specific,
include code snippets, and be sure to update as dependencies and versions
change.

```markdown
---
title: Component name (you won't need to write this)
description: Component description (you won't need to write this)
tabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']
---

<PageDescription>

<!-- How to build a [component name] using React. For code usage with other
frameworks, please follow the links in the live demo on the usage tab. -->

</PageDescription>

<AnchorLinks>

<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>[Component use-case]</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Component API</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>

</AnchorLinks>

## Overview

<!--
This should include the default use-case(s) for a component, at most 2.
This should be the most common way the component is used.
It should summarize what this common is for and provide snippets for how
to accomplish these common use-cases.

Example: You can build a breadcrumb using a combination of the Breadcrumb and BreadcrumbItem components. The Breadcrumb component accepts a list of BreadcrumbItem components as children and each BreadcrumbItem is responsible for displaying the page links in the hierarchy.
-->

### Skeleton

<!--
Include which component/s to use for the skeleton state and why it might be useful.

Example:

*You can use the BreadcrumbSkeleton component to render a skeleton variant of an breadcrumb. This is useful to display while content in your breadcrumb is being fetched from an external resource like an API.*
-->

## [Use case, for example, Skeleton state or Sorting]

<!--
Each use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,
if an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.

If the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like
how you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this
section.

This section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,
along with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.
-->

## Component API

### [Component name] props

| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |

<!--
* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that
* Specify the default value if applicable
* Provide a description if applicable
* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations
* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)
* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order
-->

#### [Component name][prop name]

<!--
Used to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets

### Accessibility template

The accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are
accessible. The published information helps users understand all the
accessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance
on creating the
[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).

<PageDescription>

<!--
There are 2 stock page descriptions.
Choose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.
** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.

Example 1:
Design annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the
standard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.

Example 2:
No accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in
mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many
other accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

<!--
This keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.

Example 1:
-->

Each accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse
accordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded
accordions integrate into the tab order automatically.

<!--
Example 2:
Each page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current
page, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button
for the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation
-->

<!--
**Images**
Use one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.
Normally these images go across 8 columns.
images should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png
The ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.
The caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.
Example:
![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)
<Caption>
  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.
</Caption>
-->
<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![example of (componet_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)

<Caption>
  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<!--
The Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed
-->

## Design recommendations

Design annotations are needed for the following instances.

<!--
Some of the possible subheadings here include:
- headings
- alignment
- labeling
- meaningful order

Each should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.

Example:

### Headings
Carbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.

-->

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

<!--
Provide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to refernce the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.

- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the
following symbols: <element>, 'variable' and "value".
- End each bulleted list item with a period.

Example:
- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.

-->
```

## Documenting patterns

Patterns show reusable combinations of components and templates that address
common user objectives with sequences and flows. Because they are more
complicated than components, you may need to adjust the topic order to best tell
the story — but your pattern should cover all of the topics outlined in the
following templates.

### Pattern template: for one variant

Use this template for documenting patterns that have a single variant. You can
see this template in use for [Notification](/patterns/notification-pattern/).

```markdown

title: Pattern name
description: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.

## Overview

This section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

For example, use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

Use the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.
Depending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these
headings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general "Designing
with [pattern]" heading. See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)
as an example.

### Types of [pattern]

If the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use
cases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.

See the
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)
pattern and the
[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
pattern for examples.

### Behaviors

Describe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states
and content.

### Best practices

Are there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.

For examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see
[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and
[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See the
[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
and the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)
for examples.

### Other use cases

If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here
with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for
using one solution over another.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)
and guidelines, and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

For examples, see the
[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)
and the
[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).

## Related

Which components are used when building this pattern? Did you reference other
patterns? List them here.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.

## References

Help designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way
you implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles
that you found helpful.

## Feedback

### Pattern template: for multiple variants

Use this template for documenting patterns that have multiple types or variants.
You can see this template in use for [Dialog](/patterns/dialog-pattern/) and
[Loading](/patterns/loading-pattern/).

```markdown

## Overview

Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern
and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.

The purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.

### Anatomy

It can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.
See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)
and the
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
for examples of this visual treatment.

Alternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the
pattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with
callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### [Pattern] variants

Include a table with the variants discussed in this pattern. Include a short
description about the usage of each pattern variant. The table in
[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#variants)
is a good example of the level of detail required.

The variant names should link to the H2 headings for the variants below.

Add more columns, if needed. For example, you could add a column that includes
short explanations about when not to use the variant and guide the user to an
alternative that may be more appropriate.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section covers _universal_ content related to all variants, and depending
on the requirements of your pattern, may include the following H3s.

### When to use

If you need to elaborate on the content included in the pattern variants table
in the Overview, include that detail here. The
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#when-to-use)
is a good example of the kind of content to include.

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern and
provide alternatives.

### Universal behaviors

Describe any behaviors that are universal to all pattern variants, and include
guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
for an example.

### Other considerations

If there are any other considerations particular to your pattern that are
applicable to all variants, include them here.

## [Pattern] variant

Rename this H2 heading with the first pattern variant name, and repeat for all
variants within this pattern. These sections should map directly to the variant
table in the Overview.

This section describes the pattern variant in detail, and highlights content
that is _unique_ to the pattern variant. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

The H3s headings below are suggested that be included and adapted to suit the
requirements and complexity of the variant.

Include an introductory paragraph about the pattern variant to set context.

### [Pattern variant] anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern variant. See
the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Provide use cases and situations for when this pattern should be used.

### When not to use

If required, also include a "When not to use" section with details about when
not to use and suggest alternatives.

### Designing with [pattern variant]

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the variant in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

### [Pattern variant] behaviors

Describe behaviors specific to the pattern variant, including guidance on
interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

[Dropdown component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage)
and the
[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See the
[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
and the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)
for examples.

### Other use cases

If there are similar use cases that may require a different solution, include
details here and explain the reasons for using one solution over another.

Repeat the H2 heading `Pattern variant` with the necessary H3 headings for each
variant within the pattern.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,
and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

## Writing better content

As you fill out the templates above, please keep these things in mind when
writing content for Carbon.

- Aim for a friendly and encouraging tone.
- Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun ("you").
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text,
  the easier it is for all users to understand.
- Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content
  switcher and Data table.

## Publishing updates

Ready to get your work reviewed and published? There are two ways to do this,
depending on your experience with GitHub. You may also draft your content and
bring it to
[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)
to get further guidance.

### Editing in browser

#### How to edit an existing page

If you are editing an existing docs page, the easiest option is to click on the
`Edit this page on GitHub` link that appears at the bottom of every page on the
site. The link opens the specific GitHub page where you can edit the content and
then propose the change with a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by
the Carbon team. This is the easiest and most commonly used approach by
contributors.

#### How to add a new page or image

To start, go to the Carbon website repository
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website). Navigate to the
left hand corner above the files and click `main`. From here, type in a new
branch name that reflects your work. For
example,`add-accordion-accessibility-guidance`. Once that new branch is created,
navigate to where the new file will be stored for a
[component](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/components)
or
[pattern](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/patterns).

Ensure you are in the branch you created, then navigate to `Add file` in the
upper right-hand corner. To add a new guidance page, click `create new file`
button. Title the file one of the following: `usage.mdx`, `style.mdx`,
`code.mdx`, or `accessibility.mdx`. To add an image, make sure you are in the
image folder and click `Upload files`.

After filling out the markdown template or adding an image, click
`Commit changes`. Describe your work and double check that you are on the branch
you created. If you are in the wrong branch, you will have to copy your content
into the correct branch.

Once you have committed your changes, go to the
[Pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/pulls)
page. Compare `base: main` to your branch and click `Create new pull request`.
Your contribution will be reviewed by the Carbon team!

### Editing in a local environment

Alternatively, if you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates
and are up for a more advanced option, you'll want to fork the repo and install
some of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier
workflow for you long term, but takes some time to set up.

If you are familiar with this process, you can
[fork the repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submission-guidelines)
and get started. Otherwise, reach out to the Carbon team on slack or
[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)
and we'll help you find the best way to contribute.
