## Types of contribution

There are several ways you can contribute, depending on your interest and
bandwidth.

### Component enhancements

This work involves enhancing our components in code, like adding new features or
variants. Designers are often responsible for researching UX and visual
solutions and then creating a design spec for developers.
[Here are issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)
in our enhancement backlog that need design or development work.

### Design kits

This work is all about creating and updating reusable components in Figma.
You'll get valuable Figma experience and will collaborate with the Figma Guild.
Check out the
[status of design kits](https://www.figma.com/file/CFMtqV5Nztdbm0mi2UiDLg/Library-%2B-Template-Planning?type=design&node-id=3713-26762&mode=design&t=HqvAYXUeccKNMstT-0)
and get involved by reaching out to the contacts listed.

### Website documentation

All components and patterns require usage, style, code, and accessibility
guidance on the Carbon website. You can learn how to contribute documentation
smoothly and utilize our markdown templates on the
[documentation](/contributing/documentation/) page. A list of components that
still need documentation help can be found
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/2085).

### Fixing issues and bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[filling out a bug report](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)
and, ideally, submitting a pull request with a fix.

### Icons and pictograms

You can find instructions on how to create and contribute
[UI icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/contribute),
[app icons](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/app-icons/production),
and
[pictograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/pictograms/contribute)
on the IBM Design Language site.

## The process

Whether you're contributing code, designs, or documentation, there's a process
to follow. Here's what it looks like:

### 1. Find a project to work on

#### Volunteer for existing work

The best way to volunteer is to look through
[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)
labeled with `needs: community contribution`. You can also filter by
[code](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+label%3A%22needs%3A+code+contribution%22+)
or
[design](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+label%3A%22needs%3A+design+contribution%22+)
work. Put a comment in the issue saying you'd like to help.

The Carbon team is also happy to help you find a good first issue. Just stop by
our [office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or send us a slack message.

#### Submit an idea

Have a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a
bug? First, be sure to look through the
[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make
sure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the
[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).
If you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let is know in your
issue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.

### 2. Iterate and get feedback

Most contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or
join [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Figma
Guild, Data Viz Guild, or office hours. In these sessions, it is common to share
work in progress and ask lots of questions. As you make progress, update your
GitHub issue.

### 3. Review and publish

#### Code deliverables

Work that results in code will be reviewed directly in a pull request.
Maintainers will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking questions
and suggesting changes before they merge your code. When you need to make a
change, commit and push to your branch normally. Once all revisions to your pull
request are complete, a maintainer will squash and merge your commits for you.

#### Contributor License Agreement

The Carbon core team is part of IBM. To accept contributions, we need a signed
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from you before code contributions can be
reviewed and merged. You will be prompted to do this in your PR, but if you have
questions, please don't hesitate
to [reach out](/help/contact-us/#slack-channels).

#### Design deliverables

For work that does not have a code deliverable, such as revisions to Figma
libraries, ask the Carbon team how to finish your contribution.
