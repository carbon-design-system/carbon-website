## How to write a pattern

We’ve created guidelines to help you prepare a complete and comprehensive
pattern. There are two Markdown templates to choose from:

- **Pattern with a single variant**: Use this template if your pattern has one
  primary solution. This is the most common.
- **Pattern with multiple variants**: Use this template if your content covers
  multiple variants of the pattern.

You may need to adjust the topic order to best tell the story but your pattern
should cover all of the topics outlined in each of these templates.

If you would like some assistance with the best approach for your pattern,
please [reach out](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/contact-us). We'd be
happy to work through the options with you.

## Overview

This section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

For example, use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

Use the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.
Depending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these
headings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general "Designing
with [pattern]" heading. See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)
as an example.

### Types of [pattern]

If the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use
cases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.

See the
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)
pattern and the
[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
pattern for examples.

### Behaviors

Describe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states
and content.

### Best practices

Are there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.

For examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see
[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and
[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See the
[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
and the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)
for examples.

### Other use cases

If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here
with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for
using one solution over another.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)
and guidelines, and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

For examples, see the
[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)
and the
[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).

## Related

Which components are used when building this pattern? Did you reference other
patterns? List them here.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.

## References

Help designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way
you implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles
that you found helpful.

## Feedback

Help us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and
leaving any other comments on
[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).

## Overview

Include a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern
and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.

The purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.

### Anatomy

It can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.
See the
[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)
and the
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)
for examples of this visual treatment.

Alternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the
pattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with
callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### [Pattern] variants

Include a table with the variants discussed in this pattern. Include a short
description about the usage of each pattern variant. The table in
[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#variants)
is a good example of the level of detail required.

The variant names should link to the H2 headings for the variants below.

Add more columns, if needed. For example, you could add a column that includes
short explanations about when not to use the variant and guide the user to an
alternative that may be more appropriate.

## Designing with [pattern]

This section covers _universal_ content related to all variants, and depending
on the requirements of your pattern, may include the following H3s.

### When to use

If you need to elaborate on the content included in the pattern variants table
in the Overview, include that detail here. The
[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#when-to-use)
is a good example of the kind of content to include.

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern and
provide alternatives.

### Universal behaviors

Describe any behaviors that are universal to all pattern variants, and include
guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Visual guidance

Cover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or
special treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.
See
[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)
for an example.

### Other considerations

If there are any other considerations particular to your pattern that are
applicable to all variants, include them here.

## [Pattern] variant

Rename this H2 heading with the first pattern variant name, and repeat for all
variants within this pattern. These sections should map directly to the variant
table in the Overview.

This section describes the pattern variant in detail, and highlights content
that is _unique_ to the pattern variant. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

The H3s headings below are suggested that be included and adapted to suit the
requirements and complexity of the variant.

Include an introductory paragraph about the pattern variant to set context.

### [Pattern variant] anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern variant. See
the
[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)
for an example.

### When to use

Provide use cases and situations for when this pattern should be used.

### When not to use

If required, also include a "When not to use" section with details about when
not to use and suggest alternatives.

### Designing with [pattern variant]

Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.

Show the variant in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this
pattern.

### [Pattern variant] behaviors

Describe behaviors specific to the pattern variant, including guidance on
interactions, and changes in states and content.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

details here and explain the reasons for using one solution over another.

Repeat the H2 heading `Pattern variant` with the necessary H3 headings for each
variant within the pattern.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,
and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

## First steps to contributing

If you’ve designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it
back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their
projects.

Start by opening a
[Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new).
Include a detailed description in which you:

- Define your pattern and explain the rationale
- Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- Clarify whether it uses existing components, new components, or both
- Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other
  products

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you
should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with
suggestions.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you’re not able to complete all
of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.
