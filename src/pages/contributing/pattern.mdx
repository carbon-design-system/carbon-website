Patterns are best practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. They show
reusable combinations of components and templates that address common user
objectives with sequences and flows.

## First steps to contributing

If you’ve designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it
back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their
projects.

Start by opening a
[Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new).
Include a detailed description in which you:

- Define your pattern and explain the rationale
- Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- Clarify whether it uses existing components, new components, or both
- Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other
  products

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you
should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with
suggestions.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you’re not able to complete all
of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.

## How to write a pattern

We’ve created guidelines to help you prepare a complete and comprehensive
pattern. These guidelines and the required structure are included in the
Markdown template below.

Depending on the pattern, you may need to adjust the structure but your pattern
should cover all of the topics outlined here.

```markdown
## Overview

This section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”

- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.
- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.

### Anatomy

Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern.

`Show pattern in visual form`

### When to use

Include a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.

For example, use this pattern when:

- Situation 1
- Situation 2

### When not to use (optional)

If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.

## The solution

This section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written
explanations and visuals to tell the story.

### Behaviors, structure, and functionality

- Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.
- Describe pattern behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in
  states and content.
- Show the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to
  illustrate your guidance.

Different patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and
hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are
telling. See our
[production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines)
for information about creating assets for the IBM Design System.

- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of
  components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the
  pattern's behavior.

Provide a [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/docs/getting-started/) with any
symbols you've created in the development of this pattern.

### Best practices

List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.

- Do's
- Dont's

### Other use cases

If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here
with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for
using one solution over another.

## Accessibility

Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets
[accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines,
and provide details of compliance.

For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box
to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”

## Related

Which components did you use when building this pattern? Did you reference other
patterns? List them here.

If necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.

## References

Help designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way
you implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles
that you found helpful.

## Feedback

Help us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and
leaving any other comments on
[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).
