If you've designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their projects.

## First steps to contributing

The process for contributing a pattern will depend on the pattern's complexity, but all contributions start by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new). Include a detailed description in which you:

- Define your pattern and explain the rationale
- Clarify whether it uses existing components, new components, or both
- Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other products

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with suggestions at each step.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you're not able to complete all of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to pick up where you leave off.

## Parts of a pattern contribution

Here are all of the steps for a complete contribution.

#### 1. Provide a rationale

Explain how your pattern will address user needs and solve a problem. Carbon serves the widest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any research and feedback.

#### 2. Explain behaviors, content structure, and functionality

- Describe pattern behaviors with descriptions, user flows, and/or prototypes.
- Use wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components.
- Show the content structure and content elements required, such as title, body, image, labels, video.
- Include details of how the pattern user experience meets standards for accessibility.
- Show the pattern in context.

#### 3. Create pattern visuals

- Create high fidelity designs and prototypes that follow our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines).
- Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets [accessibility standards and guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview), and provide details of compliance.

#### 4. Create design specs

- If you are creating new components for use in the pattern, you'll need to create sizing and styling annotations for these new components. The design specs should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design in code. Check out our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines) to get started.
- If you are using a combination of new and existing components, you should note clearly where each is used.

#### 5. Create Sketch symbols

- Any new patterns or changes to existing patterns will also live in a Sketch kit and so you will need to create Sketch symbols for components used.
- Check out [Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for creating a symbol.

#### 6. Document the pattern

- Document pattern guidelines and usage to be used on the site, being sure to include the context and the rationale for any choices.
- The site [documentation](./documentation) should include your contextual images and step-by-step instructions that allow designers to effectively implement your pattern.
- See [anatomy of a pattern](#anatomy-of-a-pattern) if you aren't sure what information to include.

#### 7. Prepare for experimental release

If accepted, the pattern will be released as [Experimental](/experimental/about/overview) until community tested and approved for general production.

## Anatomy of a pattern

Include as much information as possible when documenting your pattern. The context is invaluable for product designers building with your pattern.

### Title and page description

**Name and describe your pattern.** Your pattern should have a clear title and a short, direct description. This is the information many designers will use to decide if the pattern is right for their problem.

### Overview

**Define your pattern with a name and a problem statement.** This is where you should explain a user's needs, and how the pattern meets those needs. It's also where you should communicate what a designer needs to know about the pattern.

**Detail the pattern's status and its goals, and show a high-level image of the pattern in use.** If the pattern is design-ready but needs code implementation, ask for help. Define what the final state of the pattern can and will be.

### Behavior guidance

**Explain what to do and what not to do.** Some guidance may need context, and this context can be provided with contextual images and scenarios.

**Include guidance on interactions and states.** Most patterns depend on interactions with components, which includes the motion, behavior, and states of those components. Define these, including any context necessary.

**Use visuals wherever possible.** User experience diagrams are invaluable for product designers. Show a user's flow through your pattern, and include images of an actual product at each step of the way.

### Assets

**Include any resources and references.** Attach and document any page templates, design guidelines, and design software assets.

**Document how a user would navigate your pattern.** Many sites and apps include usage documentation. Provide whatever documentation you might have to make onboarding and use easier.

### References

**Create a functional prototype.** The best way to prove your pattern solves a problem is to let designers test it. A link to the actual implementation is best, and a demo is also valuable.

**Explain any accessibility testing you conducted.** No individual component or pattern can be accessible, but they can be used in an accessible way to create an accessible experience. Include any research and proof you may have in your pattern documentation.

**Create a design specification.** This includes the exact dimensions, layout, and tokens you used to implement the pattern.

**Offer any development notes you may have.** Many patterns don't require specific developer attention to implement. If there's any information specific to code implementation, include it here.

### MetadataÂ 

**Surface a changelog.** Seeing regular updates lets a designer know the pattern is still maintained. It also offers insight into any decisions that may have been made.

**Include a list of related components.** Patterns use several components and function alongside several others. List those here, along with links to where they're hosted.

**Link to related patterns.** This may not be the right pattern for a designer's problem. Link to related patterns to provide full usage context.

**Include a link to the component's maintainer.** It's likely there will be times when a pattern's maintainer must be contacted.

**Communicate what happens next.** If there are any outstanding issues or gaps, include those here. Ask for help if you need it, and be transparent about the completeness of the pattern.
