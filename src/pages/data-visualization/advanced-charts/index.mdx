<PageDescription>

Advanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets. While less intuitive than basic charts, the visualizations should still tell a story the user can understand.

## Alluvial diagram

Alluvial diagrams are a type of flow diagram that represents changes in network structure over time.

## Heat maps

A heat map is a graphical representation of data where individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. In light themes, the darkest color denotes the largest value. In dark themes, the lightest color denotes the largest value.

Heat maps can leverage the full range of the palette (from 10-100) to maximize contrast. When there is no inflection point in the data (e.g. a 0 value midway between -100 and +100) a one directional, sequential heat scale such as light cyan to dark cyan is the best visualization practice.

The 1px stroke between the values helps add clarity and contrast — especially when the data is complex. However, generally speaking, the 3:1 min contrast requirement does not apply to heat maps.

## Tree diagram

A tree diagram visually represents a hierarchy in a tree-like structure.

## Geography with overlays

### Choropleth map

A choropleth map uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placement of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

</Row>

### Proportional symbol

Symbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions. A common symbol used is a bubble with the area of the circle proportional to its value in the dataset.

<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

### Connecting lines

Connection maps display points on a map connected by straight or curved lines.

Connection maps are most useful when showing connections and relationships geographically. They can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links.

Connection maps are particularly powerful when revealing spatial patterns through the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are on a map.
