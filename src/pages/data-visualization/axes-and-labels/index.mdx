Axes and labels provide critical context for the information within a chart. Use
simple, easy-to-understand descriptors and metrics to label your chart and axes.

## Starting at zero

**Always start numerical axes at zero for part-to-whole and comparisons
charts.** For bar and area charts, a truncated Y-axis can distort the perceived
scale of a chart, making a small difference appear more significant than it is.

**It's acceptable to start line charts and scatter plots at a value higher than
zero.** These types of visualizations are less sensitive to distortion because
they communicate trends rather than difference in size or quantity. In these
cases, cropping the Y-axis helps users better identify the direction of change.

## Gaps in data

Use the designated texture to denote the range or period when data is not
available. Always label both start and end points where data is not available.

## Breaks in axes

Sometimes it's useful to skip part of the axis to bring data on the extreme ends
into view without distortion. When axes contain a break, use a sinusoidal line
to replace the straight axis line.

On the X-axis, the break may be fluid with graph area size, with a minimum width
of 16px. On the Y-axis, we recommend fixing the distance break at 16px.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>

</Row>

If data is available during an axis break, restyle line segments to use 0.5px
stroke and hide circles representing data points.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>

If data isn't available between break points, denote the data gap with a
texture.

## Time series

#### Consistent increments

If any form of axis compression is required, use the provided
[axis break](#breaks-in-axes) styling to visually denote the compression.

#### Localization

In time series, X-axis labels reflect the time increment in the data. When
possible, use localized date and time format, or user preference. Otherwise, the
chart defaults to the format presented below.

#### Landmark labels

Whenever data cross into a new time cycle, such as a new day, month, or year,
semibold the label to emphasize the transition.
