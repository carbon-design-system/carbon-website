<PageDescription>

Legends summarize the distinguishing visual properties of a visualization. A legend or key helps the user build the necessary associations between data, colors, and texture to make sense of a chart.

## Starting at zero

#### When when not to start at zero

Always start numerical axis at zero for part-to-whole and comparisons charts, such as bar and area charts. A truncated Y axis can distort the perceived scale of a chart, making a small difference look more significant than it is.

#### When to start at zero

Line charts and scatter plots are less sensitive to this distortion because they are intended to communicate trends and not relative size of the difference. In these cases, cropping the Y axis helps users better identify the direction of change.

</Row>

## Gaps in data

Use the designated texture to denote the range or period when data is not available. Always label both start and end points where data is not available.

## Breaks in axes

Sometimes it's useful to skip part of the axis to bring data on the extreme ends into view without distortion. When axes contain a break, use a sinusoidal line to replace the straight axis line.

On the X axis, the break may be fluid with graph area size, with a minimum width of 16px. On the Y axis, we recommend fixing the distance break at 16px.

If data is available during the break, restyle line segment to use 0.5px stroke and hide circles representing data points.

<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>

</Row>

If data isn't available between break points, denote the data gap with a texutre.

<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>

## Time series

In time series, X-axis labels reflect the time increment in the data. When possible, use localized date and time format, or user preference. Otherwise, the chart defaults to the format presented below.

Whenever data crosses into a new time cycle, such as a new day, month, or year, semibold the label to make it a “landmark” label to provide additional context for labels following it.
