title: Bar graph
description: Bar graphs use rectangles or bars to represent quantitative information. Bars make it easy to identify individual values and compare them as each bar is visually distinct.

Refer to the style tab on the
[Data Vis overview page](/data-visualization/overview/style) for base graph
style specifications.

## Structure

The height of a bar varies based on the value for that data increment. The width
of a bar is calculated based on the width of the graph and the number of bars.
In other words, the more bars there are in a graph the thinner the bars will be
and vice versa.

A grouped bar graph follows the same width and height rules for a single bar
graph data set. Spacing between groups of bar graphs is larger than bars within
a group. Maintain a minimum of 2px between bars within a group to meet color
contrast standards.
