    "Bar (vertical)": "Bar charts use vertical or horizontal data markers to compare individual values. You can use them to compare discrete data or show trends over time.",
    "Bubble": "Bubble charts use data points and bubbles to plot measures anywhere along a scale. One measure is plotted along each axis. The size of the bubble represents the third measure. You can use bubble charts to represent financial data or any data where measured values are related.",
    "Grouped bar (discrete)": "A grouped bar chart, also known as a clustered bar graph, multi-set bar chart, or grouped column chart, is a type of bar graph that is used to compare values across multiple categories.",
    "Stacked bar (discrete)": "Stacked bar charts are useful for comparing proportional contributions within a category. They plot the relative value that each data series contributes to the total.",
    "Line": "Line charts plot data at regular intervals connected by lines. You can use line visualizations to show trends over time and compare several data sets.",
    "Scatter": "Scatter plot visualizations use data points to plot two measures anywhere along a scale, not only at regular tick marks. You can use scatter plots to explore correlations between different measures.",
    "Step": "Stepped line charts plot data at regular intervals, forming a series of steps between data points. You can use line visualizations to show trends over time and compare several data sets."
