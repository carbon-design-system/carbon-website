<PageDescription>

A Gantt chart is a project management tool that illustrates work completed over
a period of time in relation to the time planned for the work. It typically
includes two sections: the left side outlines a list of tasks, while the right
side has a timeline with schedule bars that visualize work.

## Card Component

Card lies on the y-axis of the Gantt chart, the cards are used to show any
additional information about the task bar. Cards can expand to include sub cards
that have the details of a sub task.

## Task component

A visual representation of an action that is tracked across time on a gantt
chart. It depicts the action relative to time it will take complete and when to
start.

## Design recommendations

When designing the Gantt chart make sure to arrange task bars with contrasting
colors next to each other and similar colors away from each other. Tasks should
have a clear title and all users who are assigned listed in the card.
