## Overview

Interactive maps put data in context to immediately provide users with the
information that is related to spacial orientation. These are basic usages of
interactive maps:

- To indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas
- To identify data that is overlayed in geographical regions
- To show connections and relationships geographically

<br />

This pattern explores the following approaches:

- Basic types of maps that are in different contexts
- Map controls and legends that help users identify portions of the map

### Map technology

Each team needs to decide which map technology best meets the needs of their
users. When you choose a base map, first determine whether the
[Carbon Mapbox offerings](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/advanced-charts/#mapbox)
work for your project. If not, choose the map technology that provides the best
experience for your users.

## Anatomy

Although the map technology can vary, the controls, legends, and styling needs
to be the same for common features across interactive maps. Maps, unlike other
components, are always full bleed.

This guidance provides details on placement of the components and the zones for
controls.

1. **Map settings (optional):** Map settings can be accessed in the page header
   area to configure the map view (for example, the map layers or controls that
   you can interact with on the map). The map settings open a configuration pane
   on the right, and are only available in full-page views.
2. **Map controls:** These controls change the map display, including map
   layers, recenter control, and zoom controls. Related tools are grouped, with
   zoom controls always placed as the last group.
3. **Map:** A diagrammatic representation of an area that shows physical
   features such as cities and roads. Maps are always full bleed.
4. **Map watermark:** The dedicated location for the map brand attribute.
5. **Map legend:** The dedicated legend placement for all map use cases.

## Map page types

#### Map page types

Users can view and interact with maps on three different page types.

| Map page type                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Map on a card](/data-visualization/maps/index#map-on-a-card)                 | This map type is contained within a card on a dashboard. This type is useful when you want to provide location context in relation to other data on the dashboard. Interactions might be limited due to the card size, but can be expanded for full control.                              |
| [Full-page map](/data-visualization/maps/index#full-page-map)                 | This map type is usually a full page display but can also be paired with additional sections of information. This type is generally a feature within an application. It is useful when users need full map controls and more space to understand the full context of their data on a map. |
| [Large screen map display](/data-visualization/maps/large-screen-map-display) | This map type is generally the only feature within the application, and is often viewed on a larger screen. This type is useful when all of the work is done on the map or as a read-only map view to monitor data.                                                                       |

### Map on a card

The map on the card is contained within a card on a dashboard and is always full
bleed. This map type is useful to provide location context to the dashboard.
This type can also provide some user interactivity, depending on the size of the
card and type of interactivity that is needed. For more map card, sizing
details, and breakpoints, we link out to our pattern asset library (PAL)
ecosystem
[interactive map](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ai-applications/design/patterns/dashboards-v2/overview#interactive-maps)

Due to limited space, maps on a card use the small map control sizes. The map
controls are dynamically hidden or displayed depending on the height of the card
and the available screen space. You will need to define which controls are in
view at the various breakpoints. At a minimum, you must include a legend and
zoom controls on the map.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

### Full-page map

This map type is usually a full page display but can also be paired with
additional sections of information. This type is generally a feature within an
application. It is useful when users need full map controls and more space to
understand the full context of their data on a map.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Related content

Related content for the map can be placed outside of the map area, or as a
container overlay on the map.

- Place the related content outside of the map if you don't want it to move or
  obscure the map view.
- Place the related content as an overlay on the map if you want to optimize for
  map space on the page.

### Large screen map display

This map type is generally the only feature within the application, and is often
viewed on a larger screen. This type is useful when all of the work is done on
the map or as a read-only map view to monitor data.

Due to its scale, this map type generally uses a non-influencer grid and exceeds
the maximum Carbon grid layout breakpoint size.

#### Display mode

Display mode is a large screen map display that does not include controls. This
mode is often displayed at a high resolution (3840 px by 2860 px), is usually up
on a wall in a room, and is set up by a manager. It shows all map layers and
assets on the map, so the user can view all of the information at once.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## Map controls

Map controls are elements that are clicked or tapped to trigger an action (or to
select and trigger an action). They communicate calls to action to the user and
allow users to interact with the map in various ways. The map controls directly
overlay the map on the right side. Each icon button indicates the action that
occurs when the user interacts with it. The type of map controls that are used
must be quick ways in which the user can change anything that is shown on the
map.

### Visual guidelines for map controls

#### Placement

At a minimum, always include the zoom controls on a map. This control is
anchored at the lower right corner of the map. All other map controls are
anchored at the upper right corner of the page, and can be organized by
importance or most-used. Include consistent spacing between separate map
controls, and group any related controls together when applicable.

#### Size

There are two sizes of map controls—medium (40px) and small (32px). The medium
map controls are used for full-page map and small map controls are used for maps
on card.

#### Padding

There are two padding sizes on map—32px for full-page maps and 16px for maps on
a card.

</Row>

#### Color

While maps have three color themes which are dark, light, and neutral, map
buttons have two main colors—white and gray 90. White buttons are used on light
and neutral theme. Gray 90 buttons are used on dark theme.

<br />
<br />

### Map control configurations

Map controls can be configured through a configuration pane on the right side of
the page. The map controls are accessed through a map settings icon in the page
header area (the map settings are global controls for the map). Users can set
configurations according to their preferences, including these examples:

- Toggling the display of map controls on the screen.
- Setting the parameters for the different map layers.
- Creating custom views for the information that is displayed on the map at the
  same time.

<InlineNotification>
  Note: The content and layout of the map configuration pane is still in
  experimental mode. If you apply the map controls to your use case, we ask that
  you share them back to the PAL team so we can further evolve our guidance on
  map configurations.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Map control variations

Map controls can be stand-alone or placed in groups to group related actions
together. For easy access, surface the most commonly used actions on the map.

#### Toggle controls

Toggle controls are icon buttons that toggle a layer or action on or off for the
map. Click the icon button to turn on the control, and click the icon button
again to turn it off.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>Example of toggle controls</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Flyout controls

Flyout controls expand out a group of related actions that the user can take but
do not always need to be visible on the map. To trigger the flyout, click the
icon button with the left caret indicator to activate the flyout pane. Click the
same icon button to close the flyout when finished.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Map controls - flyout](/images//map-pattern-12.gif)

<Caption>Example of flyout controls</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Scrolling controls

If the map uses many related controls, limit the number that is displayed and
include scroll controls on either end so the user can scroll through the entire
set of map controls. Scrolling controls are only available for full-page map use
cases.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

## Point data

## Map legends

A map legend is necessary to help the user understand the information that is on
the map. The legend placement is anchored on the bottom of the page.

### Simple legend

For simple legends, the legend is anchored on the lower left corner of the map,
and is displayed in a floating container as an overlay on the map. The container
has an 80% opacity. The container uses a drop shadow to provide separation from
the map and also to allow the map to show through.

### Full-bleed legends

If multiple legends can be displayed at once, use the full-bleed legend on the
bottom of the page. This legend offers more space to display multiple legend
types, and it can be collapsed to gain back more screen space for the map.

<InlineNotification>
  Note: Work on displaying multiple legends at one time is still in-progress. If
  you have any contributions and use cases, we ask that you to share them back
  to the PAL team so we can further evolve our map legend guidance.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## Accessibility

#### Navigation

Users should be able to navigate the map using the  `ARROW` keys.

#### Zoom

Users can zoom in/zoom out using either the mouse scroll or the `+` and `-`
keys.
