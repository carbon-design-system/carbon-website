## General guidelines

Pie charts show individual values that make up a whole data set so users can
compare the values to each other and see how each value compares to the whole. A
common way to express the part-to-whole relationship is to use percentages, with
the whole equaling 100% and each of its parts equaling smaller percentages
corresponding to its value relative to the whole. Expressing exact values is
useful as long as the total is also shown.
