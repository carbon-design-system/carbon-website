## General guidelines

Scatter plots are used to determine whether there is a relationship between two
sets of quantitative values by showing the linear correlation between them.
Users can identify an individual value on the x-axis and see what happens to
that value in relation to the y-axis. Taking the graph as a whole, users can see
the strength and direction of the correlation. A strong correlation has a
tighter grouping of values, whereas a weak correlation has a looser grouping. A
positive correlation shows values trending upward from left to right, which is
the opposite for a negative correlation where values trend downward from left to
right.
