## carbon-components

`carbon-components` reached it's end of support on September 30, 2024. This
package will no longer receive updates.

### What to use instead

`carbon-components` is replaced by `@carbon/styles`, but most projects don't
need to install `@carbon/styles` directly.

If you're using `@carbon/react` or `@carbon/web-components`, you do not need to
install `@carbon/styles`. All `@carbon/styles` assets are already available to
you through those framework-specific packages.

Library authors should use `@carbon/styles` if they do not already rely on a
framework-variant package such as `@carbon/react`.

### Migration

For those using `carbon-components@10.x`, the
[v11 migration guide](/migrating/guide/develop/) has all the details of how to
update.

For those using `carbon-components@11.x`, these versions are already a direct
re-export of `@carbon/styles`. See the above section on what to use instead.

[contact us](/help/contact-us/).

## carbon-components-react

`carbon-components-react` reached it's end of support on September 30, 2024.
This package will no longer receive updates.

### What to use instead

`carbon-components-react` is replaced by `@carbon/react`.

### Migration

For those using `carbon-components-react@7.x`, the
[v11 migration guide](/migrating/guide/develop/) has all the details of how to
update.

For those using `carbon-components-react@8.x`, these versions are already a
direct re-export of `@carbon/react`. After installing `@carbon/react`, you can
replace all imports and usages of `carbon-components-react` with
`@carbon/react`. This should be an in-place update with no other changes
required.

[contact us](/help/contact-us/).

## v10 Elements packages

All v10 assets reached end of support on September 30, 2024, including v10.x
ranges of elements packages. This includes:

- `@carbon/colors@10.x`
- `@carbon/elements@10.x`
- `@carbon/grid@10.x`
- `@carbon/layout@10.x`
- `@carbon/motion@10.x`
- `@carbon/themes@10.x`
- `@carbon/type@10.x`

### What to use instead

The v11.x ranges of these packages should be used instead.

### Migration

The [v11 migration guide](/migrating/guide/develop/) has all the details of how
to update.
