## Install design kits

Our primary design kit is [Sketch](/designing/kits/sketch) and we also have
[Adobe XD](/designing/kits/adobe-xd) and [Axure](/designing/kits/axure) kits
available. Head on over to the Design kits section and follow the install
instructions to get set up.

These kits come with Carbon components so you don't have to build them. By using
the kits you automatically get any updates made by the Carbon team so you don't
need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And when
handing off to your developers there won't be confusion about the component and
its behaviors.

In [Other resources](/designing/design-resources), you'll find links to icon
libraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates, the IBM Plex font, and the
Github repos.

## Learn about foundational guidance

Carbon expresses the IBM Design Language in product and delivers it through
tools for designers and developers including guidance, tooling, components, and
support. Learn what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles so that you
can make informed decisions in your product work.

The IBM brand systems have been developed for various IBM businesses, audiences,
categories, and offerings. Read them to understand the rationale behind every
visual and verbal detail to ensure your work is built on these important
foundations. _This content is accessible to IBMers only._

## Review our usage guidance

Our usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the
system by reading through the components and patterns documentation.

- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and
  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this
  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.

- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best
  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have
  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and
  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.
