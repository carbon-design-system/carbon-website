## Install design kits

Our primary design kits are built in [Figma](/designing/kits/figma),
[Sketch](/designing/kits/sketch), and [Adobe XD](/designing/kits/adobe-xd). All
three tools are supported by Carbon for the foreseeable future with Figma having
priority over Sketch and Adobe XD for support and maintenance. The design kits
are also available in both the latest versions of Carbon with support for v11
prioritized over v10.

These primary kits include all the Carbon core components and styles for your
reuse in your product and web experiences to create Carbon compliant designs. By
using the kits you will automatically receive updates made to the Carbon
libraries ensuring your designs stay up to date with the latest release as well
as ensuring consistency between design assets and code.

Head on over to the [Design kits](/designing/kits/sketch) section and follow the
install instructions to get set up.

### Additional design assets

In [Other resources](/designing/design-resources/), you’ll find links to icon
libraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates, the IBM Plex font, and the
Github repos. As well as additional kits for mid-fidelity wireframing and
prototyping tools like Invision Freehand and Axure.

## Learn about foundational guidance

Carbon expresses the IBM Design Language in product and delivers it through
tools for designers and developers including guidance, tooling, components, and
support. Learn what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles so that you
can make informed decisions in your product work.

The IBM brand systems have been developed for various IBM businesses, audiences,
categories, and offerings. Read them to understand the rationale behind every
visual and verbal detail to ensure your work is built on these important
foundations. _This content is accessible to IBMers only._

## Review our usage guidance

Our usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the
system by reading through the components and patterns documentation.

- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and
  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this
  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.

- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best
  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have
  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and
  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.
