## First steps

### Install your design kit

Our primary design kit is Sketch but we have Adobe XD and Axure kits available
too. Head on over to the Design kits section and follow the install instructions
to get set up.

### Check out other tools and resources

In Other resources, you'll find the four IBM theme libraries, the IBM Design
Language and icon libraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates, the IBM
Plex font, and the Github repos.

## Additional guidance

### Understand the IBM Design Language

Carbon expresses the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
in product and delivers it through tools for designers and developers including
guidance, tooling, components, and support. Take the time to read the design
language site so that you fully understand what drives IBM’s design philosophy
and principles, and can make informed decisions in your product work.

### Review our detailed usage guidance

- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and
  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this
  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.

- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best
  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have
  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and
  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.

## Connect with us
