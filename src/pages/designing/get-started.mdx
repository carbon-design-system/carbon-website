## Step 1: Learn about Carbon

By adopting Carbon, designers gain a collection of reusable assets to design
websites and user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

The [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/) is the visual
expression of IBM's brand, including color, type scale, the grid, and more.
Carbon translates the design language into code for building digital
experiences.

This is done through elements such as color tokens, type tokens, and spacing
tokens that are meant to be applied to all sorts of digital experiences through
guidance and components.

## Step 2: Access the tools

_For IBMers only:_

IBMers should get a license for Figma, our primary design kit tool. You may also
access tools we no longer support, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Axure, by heading to
the [Design Toolbox](https://w3.ibm.com/design/toolbox/). However, we no longer
maintain or update the kits for these tools. We recommend you migrate to Figma
to get the most updated kits we offer.

  </ResourceCard>
</Column>
</Row>

## Step 3: Get the Figma design kits

We maintain the core Carbon kits in [Figma](/designing/kits/figma). These kits
include all the Carbon core components and styles for reuse in your product and
web experiences. By using the kits you will automatically receive updates made
to the Carbon libraries, ensuring your designs stay up-to-date with the latest
releases. This allows you to speak the same language and have shared
functionality expectations as your developers in the hand-off and development
cycle.

Head on over to the [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma) section and follow the
instructions to get set up with Figma.

### Core design kits

Everyone using Carbon should use the following Figma core design kits as a
starting point for building user interfaces. This brings consistency and speed,
allowing teams to focus on solving more specific user tasks. Core design kits
include elements, core components, wireframes, and guidelines.

The links in the table for Figma Libraries are preview only. Some of the Figma
kits are for internal IBMers. To learn more about installing Figma Libraries and
available external libraries visit the Figma tutorial
[Figma tutorial](/designing/kits/figma).

### Additional design assets

Support for v11 Figma kits are prioritized, but
[Figma v10 kits](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/design-kits?q=v10&tool[]=figma)
are also available with limited support. In
[Other resources](/designing/design-resources/), you'll find links to icon
libraries, color palettes, plugins, and more. The Adobe XD kit is no longer
prioritized or maintained, but you may access it
[here](https://github.com/IBM/design-kit/tree/master/Adobe%20XD).

## Step 4: Review our usage guidance

Our usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the
system by reading through the components and patterns documentation.

- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and
  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this
  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.

- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best
  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have
  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and
  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.

## Step 5: Explore foundational guidance

The following sites provide guidance for creating experiences that are
consistent, provide an interoperability of experience with other offerings, and
represent IBM as a company.
