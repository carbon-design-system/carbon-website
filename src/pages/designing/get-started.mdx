## First steps

### Install your design kit

Our primary design kit is [Sketch](/designing/kits/sketch) and we also
[Adobe XD](/designing/kits/adobe-xd) and [Axure](/designing/kits/axure) kits
available. Head on over to the Design kits section and follow the install
instructions to get set up.

These kits come with Carbon components so you don't have to build them. By using
the kits you automatically get any updates made by the Carbon team so you don't
need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And when
handing off to your developers there won't be confusion about the component and
its behaviors.

### Check out other tools and resources

In [Other resources](/designing/design-resources), you'll find links to the IBM
Design Language and icon libraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates,
the IBM Plex font, and the Github repos.

## Additional guidance

### Understand the IBM Design Language

Carbon expresses the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
in product and delivers it through tools for designers and developers including
guidance, tooling, components, and support. Take the time to read the design
language site so that you fully understand what drives IBM’s design philosophy
and principles, and can make informed decisions in your product work.

### Review our detailed usage guidance

Our usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the
system by reading through the components and patterns documentation.

- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and
  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this
  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.

- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best
  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have
  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and
  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.

## Connect with us

### Join us and the Carbon community

_For IBMers only:_ If you have a question about any aspect of the kits or tools,
you can reach out to us on Slack and use that as a way to connect with your
fellow designers. Chances are someone has had a similar problem to you and will
jump in to help you out.

### Learn about what we're doing

You can find out about Carbon's latest changes and future plans on the
[Changelog and roadmap](/whats-happening/changelog-and-roadmap) page.

If you have questions, here are all the ways to [contact us](/help/contact-us).

### Join us at a meetup

Attend one of our [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups) to connect with us and
level up your skills. The weekly design playback is great for getting feedback
on work in progress from a group of designers and design leaders dedicated to
your success.

If there’s something in particular you’re interested in, we’d love to
[hear from you](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new/choose).
