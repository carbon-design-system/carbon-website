<InlineNotification>

**All themes are now available in one Figma library!** We have implemented Figma
modes and theming variables, allowing us to combine all four themes into one
library file.

## Internal users

### Get the libraries

#### 1. Sign into Figma using IBM SSO

You should be added to the IBM Figma organization automatically once you sign
in. You do not need to join or request to join any specific team to access the
libraries.

#### 2. Turn on the Carbon themes library

The `(v11) All themes - Carbon Design System` library (previously referred to as
(v11) White theme - Carbon Design System) includes all four Carbon themes,
including two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100).

Inside of a design file, navigate to the **Main menu** panel in the top left of
the toolbar (A). Open the menu and select **Libraries** from the list (B).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![internal figma instructions part 1](images/kit-figma-1.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Then in the Libraries modal that appears, find the team called
`IBM Design Systems` (C) and switch the toggle beside the
`(v11) All Themes - Carbon Design System` library to on (D).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## Start designing

### Components

Included in the library are all 40 of the Carbon components and their variants.
To insert a component, go to the **Asset** panel and find the component you
would like to use. Drag it from the asset panel onto the canvas.

View the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has
variants, you'll see fields underneath the component name to configure the
properties and values of that component set.

For more help on how to use Figma components, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants#Use_variants).

### Grids and Screens

Included in the library is an asset called `Screens`. These screens provide a
canvas that can be configured at the five 2x grid breakpoints. It also includes
the 16 column grid both with and without a left panel grid influencer.

### Color styles

The Carbon color tokens are surfaced in Figma using styles. To apply a color
style, select an object then in the **Styles** menu you can select a style from
the Carbon theme libraries or the IBM Design Language libraries. In addition to
applying color styles to objects, you can also apply Color styles to Text
layers. In addition to the Color style library, we have created a Hover color
styles library to incorporate specific hover colors per color grade.

To learn more about applying color styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040316193).

### Text styles

To apply a text style, select a text layer, then in the properties panel, choose
a text style from the `(v11) Text styles - IBM Design Language` library
depending on which version you are on. Use color styles to change the color of a
text style.

To learn more about applying text styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034-Create-and-Apply-Text-Styles#apply).
