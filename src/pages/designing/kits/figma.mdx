Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Carbon kit for Figma
contains all resources you need to get started.

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

**Available to IBM only:** the Figma kit is currently only available to IBMers
through a private Figma organization. We are working on getting the kit added to
the Figma open community and expect it to be published in May 2022.

## Get the libraries

#### 1. Sign into Figma using IBM SSO

You should be added to the IBM Figma organization automatically once you sign
in. You do not need to join or request to join any specific team to access the
libraries.

#### 2. Turn on the theme libraries

There are four Carbon themes, two light (White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray
90 and Gray 100). Each theme lives in its own Figma library. You can turn on as
many libraries as you’d like.

Inside of a design file, navigate to the **Main menu** panel in the top left of
the toolbar (A). Open the menu and select **Libraries** from the list (B).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Then in the Libraries modal that appears, find the team called
`[NEW] IBM Design Systems` (C) and switch the toggle beside a themed library,
for example the `White theme - Carbon Design System` to on (D).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

#### 3. Turn on the other IBM Design Language libraries 

Under the same team `[NEW] IBM Design Systems` you can also turn on the
following libraries:

- Color styles - IBM Design Language
- Text styles - IBM Design Language
- Icons - IBM Design Language
- Pictograms - IBM Design Language

## Start designing

### Components

Included in the library are all 32 of the Carbon components and their variants.
To insert a component, go to the **Asset** panel and find the component you
would like to use. Drag it from the asset panel onto the canvas.

View the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has
variants, you'll see fields underneath the component name to configure the
properties and values of that component set.

For more help on how to use Figma components, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants#Use_variants).

### Grids and Screens

Included in the library is an asset called `Screens`. These screens provide a
canvas that can be configured at the five 2x grid breakpoints. It also includes
the 16 column grid both with and without a left panel grid influencer.

### Color styles

The Carbon color tokens are surfaced in Figma using styles. To apply a color
style, select an object then in the **Styles** menu you can select a style from
the Carbon theme libraries or the IBM Design Language libraries. In addition to
applying color styles to objects, you can also apply Color Styles to Text
layers.

To learn more about applying color styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040316193).

### Text styles

To apply a text style, select a text layer then in the properties panel select
the text style from the `Text styles - IBM Design Language` library. Use color
styles to change the color of a text style.

To learn more about applying text styles in Figma, see the
[Figma docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957034-Create-and-Apply-Text-Styles#apply).
