## Introduction to Carbon

Learn about Carbon and its history. This video covers how the IBM Design
Language is applied to Carbon, how Carbon interacts with domain level guidance,
and what it means to be an open source design system.

[All about Carbon](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon),
[Get started](/designing/get-started), and the
[IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).

## Designing with Carbon

This video covers how to design with components and type styles, and where to
find relevant guidance and resources while designing. It also goes through the
steps of getting set up with the Carbon Sketch kits and grid template.

## Using the 2x Grid

Learn about the fundamentals of using our 2x Grid. This video gives an overview
of basic grid terminology, breakpoints, the three grid modes, and some resources
to get started designing with the 2x Grid.
