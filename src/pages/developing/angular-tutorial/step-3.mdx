<PageDescription>

This step takes our static components and populates them with data from the
GitHub GraphQL API – loading states and all. We'll be displaying Carbon
repository information in a data table.

### Preview

The [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) is very well
documented, and even though the focus of this tutorial isn't learning and using
GraphQL, it's a great opportunity to fetch Carbon-related data for this Carbon
tutorial.

To do so, we'll be using Apollo Client, the front-end component of the
[Apollo Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/intro/platform). Apollo
provides several open source tools for using GraphQL throughout your
application’s stack. Apollo Client is a sophisticated GraphQL client that
manages data and state in an application.

A [preview](https://angular-step-4-carbon-tutorial.netlify.com) of what you will
build (see repositories page):

**Note:** If you get lint errors when you copy the code from the snippets, run
`ng lint --fix` to fix them.

</InlineNotification>

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-angular](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-angular)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b angular-step-3 upstream/angular-step-3
```

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-2) left off. Stop your app
with `CTRL-C` and let's get everything installed.

## Install dependencies

We'll shortcut this using the Angular CLI, if you'd like more information head
over to
[Angular Apollo Installation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/recipes/angular-cli/)
for details.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If you have not yet installed the Angular CLI, you will need to
[install the Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) before running the Angular
Apollo Installation.

</InlineNotification>

Install the following

- `apollo-client` - package containing everything you need to set up Apollo
  Client
- `graphql` - parses your GraphQL queries
- `apollo-angular` - Apollo integration for Angular

Using the command:

```bash
ng add apollo-angular@v1
ng lint --fix
```

<InlineNotification>

​**Note:** In case you receive
`ERROR in ../node_modules/graphql/subscription/subscribe.d.ts:44:3 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'AsyncIterableIterator'.`,
you'll have to add the code below in `tsconfig.app.json` `lib`: ​

</InlineNotification>

```javascript path=src/tsconfig.app.json
"lib": [
  "es2016",
  "dom",
  "esnext.asynciterable"
],
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** In case you receive
`typings.d.ts:2:13 - error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type. Variable 'module' must be of type 'NodeModule', but here has type '{ id: string; }'.`,
you'll have to comment out or remove the code below in `typings.d.ts`:

</InlineNotification>

```javascript path=src/typings.d.ts
declare var module: {
  id: string,
};
```

## Create access token

You'll need a personal access token from your GitHub account in order to make
requests to the GitHub API. Check out
[this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
to see how to get one.

When you get to the scope/permissions step, you can leave them all unchecked. We
don't need any special permissions, we just need access to the public API.

Once you have your token, we need to put it in a place where we can use it in
our app. When your application is being built and developed, our app will parse
environmental variables in any `environment` file and make them available.

​{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```javascript path=src/environment/environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  githubPersonalAccessToken: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
};
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Go ahead and start your app with `npm start`, or, if your app is running, you'll
need to restart it to get access to this token.

## Connect to Apollo

We need to import the environment at the top of every file that we decide to use
it in:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```javascript
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Next, make your client by providing a URI for the GitHub GraphQL API as well as
an authorization header using the environmental variable you just added to
`environment.ts`.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```javascript path=src/app/graphql.module.ts
import { HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';

const uri = 'https://api.github.com/graphql'; // <-- add the URL of the GraphQL server here
export function createApollo(httpLink: HttpLink) {
  return {
    link: httpLink.create({
      uri,
      headers: new HttpHeaders({
        Authorization: `Bearer ${environment.githubPersonalAccessToken}`,
      }),
    }),
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  };
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Fetch data

### Imports

Add the following import at the top of `repo-table.component.ts`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
import { Apollo } from 'apollo-angular';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Query

Next we'll assemble our GraphQL query to fetch only the data we need from the
GraphQL API. We'll do this using the `gql` helper we just imported. The `gql`
helper lets you write GraphQL queries using interpolated strings (backticks) in
JavaScript.

You can use GitHub's [explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) tool
to write and test your own queries. Try copying the query below and experiment
with changing the properties. You can also click the "Docs" button in the top
right of the explorer to view all of the available data and query parameters.

If you'd like some more information regarding writing queries, we recommend
[Apollo's documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries) on
this topic.

First, we will add a private apollo parameter of type Apollo to the constructor
to get access to the Apollo service.

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
constructor(private apollo: Apollo) { }
```

Next, we will fetch the data in `ngOnInit()`. Add the following code right below
the `model.header` declaration:

```graphql path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
this.apollo.watchQuery({
  query: gql`
    query REPO_QUERY {
      # Let's use carbon as our organization
      organization(login: "carbon-design-system") {
        # We'll grab all the repositories in one go. To load more resources
        # continuously, see the advanced topics.
        repositories(first: 75, orderBy: { field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC }) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            url
            homepageUrl
            issues(filterBy: { states: OPEN }) {
              totalCount
            }
            stargazers {
              totalCount
            }
            releases(first: 1) {
              totalCount
              nodes {
                name
              }
            }
            name
            updatedAt
            createdAt
            description
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `
})
```

### Custom data

Our last column in the data table will be a comma-separated list of repository
and home page links, so let's create a custom cell template.

The column will have two values (`url` and `homepageUrl`) and will have the
structure of an unordered list. If the repository does not have a home page URL,
only render the repository link.

```html path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.html
<ng-template #linkTemplate let-data="data">
  <ul style="display: flex">
    <li>
      <a ibmLink [href]="data.github">GitHub</a>
    </li>
    <li *ngIf="data.homepage">
      <span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span>
      <a ibmLink [href]="data.homepage">HomePage</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ng-template>
```

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
@ViewChild('linkTemplate', null)
protected linkTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Don't forget to import `ViewChild` and `TemplateRef`.

</InlineNotification>

Now let's create a function that transforms row data to our expected header
keys. Notice how we're using our new `linkTemplate` to generate the value of the
`links` key in each row.

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
prepareData(data) {
  const newData = [];

  for (const datum of data) {
    newData.push([
      new TableItem({ data: datum.name, expandedData: datum.description }),
      new TableItem({ data: new Date(datum.createdAt).toLocaleDateString() }),
      new TableItem({ data: new Date(datum.updatedAt).toLocaleDateString() }),
      new TableItem({ data: datum.issues.totalCount }),
      new TableItem({ data: datum.stargazers.totalCount }),
      new TableItem({
        data: {
          github: datum.url,
          homepage: datum.homepageUrl
        },
        template: this.linkTemplate
      })
    ]);
  }
  return newData;
}
```

### Query component

At this point, we should run our query and `console.log()` the results to verify
that the request is working.

If there's an issue, we'll render the corresponding error message. We will also
check when loading is true, but add the implementation in the following steps.

Finally, if neither of those are true, it means we have our data! One nice
advantage of GraphQL is that as long as there are no errors, we can be certain
the properties on the data we requested aren't `undefined`.

At the end of the `watchQuery` in `ngOnInit()`:

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
.valueChanges.subscribe((response: any) => {
  if (response.error) {
    const errorData = [];
    errorData.push([
      new TableItem({data: 'error!' })
    ]);
    this.model.data = errorData;
  } else if (response.loading) {
    // Add loading state
  } else {
    console.log(response);
  }
});
```

The page will look the same as we're still rendering our static example rows,
but if you view your browser's console (e.g.
[Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)),
you should see the response from GitHub!

## Populate data table

Now that we have that data, let's populate the data table. Replace
`console.log(response);` with the following that destructures the `organization`
object. Once we have the repositories, we can call our `prepareData()` to build
the data table rows.

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
// If we're here, we've got our data!
this.model.data = this.prepareData(
  response.data.organization.repositories.nodes
);
```

Then, in `ngOnInit()` delete the static rows since we no longer need them.

## Add loading

At this point, the first time that you visit the repositories page, we're
querying the GitHub API and rendering the response through the `DataTable`
component. We could stop here, but there's more to be done! Let's add the
[Table Skeleton](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/table--skeleton).

To do so, we will need to modify `repo-table.component.html` and
`repo-table.component.ts`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```html path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.html
<ibm-table
  [skeleton]="skeleton"
  [model]="skeleton ? skeletonModel : model"
  [showSelectionColumn]="false"
  [striped]="false">
</ibm-table>
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We need to tell the loading skeleton how many rows to render, so let's use 10
skeleton rows to prepare for the next enhancement...

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
skeletonModel = Table.skeletonModel(10, 6);
skeleton = true;
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Don't forget to import `Table`.

</InlineNotification>

Then replace the comment with:

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
else if (response.loading) {
  this.skeleton = true;
}
```

and at the top of the `prepareData()` function add:

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
this.skeleton = false;
```

## Add pagination

Pagination! Instead of rendering every repository, let's add pagination to the
data table to only render 10 at a time. Depending on your specific requirements,
you may need to fetch new data each time that you interact with the pagination
component, but for simplicity, we're going to make one request to fetch all
data, and then paginate the in-memory row data.

First we will create an array and populate it with 10 rows at a time.

```javascript
data = [];
```

Next, replace the code where we call `prepareData()` with:

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
this.data = response.data.organization.repositories.nodes;
this.model.pageLength = 10;
this.model.totalDataLength = response.data.organization.repositories.totalCount;
this.selectPage(1);
```

This initializes the page size to `10` as we also specified in our loading
skeleton.

Next we will call `selectPage()`. This will initialize the offset and use
`prepareData()` to only render the subset of rows for the current "page".

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.ts
selectPage(page) {
  const offset = this.model.pageLength * (page - 1);
  const pageRawData = this.data.slice(offset, offset + this.model.pageLength);
  this.model.data = this.prepareData(pageRawData);
  this.model.currentPage = page;
}
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We only pass the rows that we want our table to display. We can do
this by slicing our array of rows depending on the first item and the page size.

</InlineNotification>

Finally, let's import the `LinkModule` and `PaginationModule` to
`repositories.module.ts` and `repo-table.component.spec` and add the template
for pagination.

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repositories.module.ts,src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.spec.ts
import { LinkModule, PaginationModule } from 'carbon-components-angular';
```

```javascript path=src/app/repositories/repositories.module.ts,src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.spec.ts
imports: [LinkModule, PaginationModule];
```

Immediately after the `ibm-table` closing tag (`/>`), add the `ibm-pagination`
component.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```html path=src/app/repositories/repo-table/repo-table.component.html
<ibm-pagination
  [model]="model"
  (selectPage)="selectPage($event)">
</ibm-pagination>
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Like the other Carbon Angular component, `pagination` component
examples can be found in
[Storybook](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/table--with-pagination)
by browsing the story and knobs.

</InlineNotification>

That does it! Your data table should fetch GitHub data on first render. You can
expand each row to see the repository's description. You can modify the
pagination items per page and cycle through pages or jump to a specific page of
repositories.

## Submit pull request
