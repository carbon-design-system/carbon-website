With two pages comprised entirely of Carbon components, let's revisit the
landing page and build a couple components of our own by using Carbon icons and
tokens.

## Preview

Carbon provides a solid foundation for building web applications through its
color palette, layout, spacing, type, as well as common building blocks in the
form of components. So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two
pages.

Next, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.
We'll create our components with considerations for accessibility and
responsiveness.

A [preview](https://angular-step-5-carbon-tutorial.netlify.com) of what you'll
build (see bottom of page):

**Note:** If you get lint errors when you copy the code from the snippets, run
`ng lint --fix` to fix them.

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-angular](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-angular)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b angular-step-4 upstream/angular-step-4
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current
directory and not continuing from the previous step):

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/angular-tutorial/step-3) left off.

## Review design

Here's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and
three subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll
assume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning
it's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,
we'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.

![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)

<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>

## Create components

First we need files for the components, so create an `Info` folder in
`src/components`. Even though we're building multiple components, their names
all start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in
components. Create these files:

### Generate modules & components using the Angular CLI

Let's generate a new module that'll handle our `InfoCard` and `InfoSection`
components:

```bash
ng generate module info
```

Now we generate our `InfoCard` and `InfoSection` components:

```bash
ng generate component info/info-card --lint-fix
```

```bash
ng generate component info/info-section --lint-fix
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `--lint-fix` flag will automatically resolve lint issues in the
newly generated files.

</InlineNotification>

Running the above commands should get you the folder structure below:

```bash
src/app/info
└──info.module.ts
└──info-card
	├──info-card.component.scss
	├──info-card.component.ts
	├──info-card.component.spec.ts
	└──info-card.component.html
└──info-section
	├──info-section.component.scss
	├──info-section.component.ts
	├──info-section.component.spec.ts
	└──info-section.component.html
```

Now let's create a JSON file that'll include our content to be shown in the
components:

```json path=src/app/info/info.json
{
  "title": "The Principles",
  "items": [
    {
      "heading": "Carbon is Open",
      "content": "It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Carbon is Modular",
      "content": "Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Carbon is Consistent",
      "content": "Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences."
    }
  ]
}
```

Now we also need to tell typescript to resolve JSON files as modules when
compiling:

```json path=src/tsconfig.app.json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"sourceMap": true,
		"declaration": false,
		...
		"resolveJsonModule": true
	},
	...
}
```

### InfoSection component

Let's create the parent component that includes the "The Principles" heading.
That markup currently looks like this in `landing-page.component.html`:

```html path=src/app/home/landing-page/landing-page.component.html
<div ibmRow class="landing-page__r3">
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">
    <h3 class="landing-page__label">The Principles</h3>
  </div>
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">Carbon is Open</div>
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">Carbon is Modular</div>
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">Carbon is Consistent</div>
</div>
```

We want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. Firstly, we want
to encapsulate the component's styles within it's dedicated stylesheet. We don't
want to include `landing-page__r3` within the component template as that's
specific to the landing page. In order to allow the landing page to have access
to styling this specific instance of an `InfoSection` component we could pass
the class into the instance of the component. However, we won't need to do any
additional styling from the `landing-page` so we can just go ahead use the
component as is.

We'll also:

- Add component class names like `.info-section` and `.info-section__heading`
- Semantically use `<section>` instead of `<div>`
- Update the grid columns to match the design
- Update the component content to use `info.json`
- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `InfoCard` components
- Remove class styling from `landing-page` component

```html path=src/app/home/landing-page/landing-page.component.html
<app-info-section></app-info-section>
```

```html path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.html
<section ibmRow class="info-section info-section__r1">
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 8, 'lg': 4}">
    <h3 class="info-section__heading">The Principles</h3>
  </div>
  <app-info-card ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"> </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"> </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"> </app-info-card>
</section>
```

As you can see we've added instances of the `InfoCard` component. There is a few
things that we need to do to resolve the errors in the browser. Firstly we need
to update `InfoModule` to be able to use the `GridModule`. At the same time we
will export the `InfoSection` and `InfoCard` components from the `InfoModule` so
that we can use them in the `HomeModule` components (specifically
`landing-page`).

```ts path=src/app/info/info.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
...
import { GridModule } from "carbon-components-angular";


@NgModule({
	declarations: [InfoCardComponent, InfoSectionComponent],
	imports: [
		CommonModule,
		GridModule
	],
	exports:  [InfoCardComponent, InfoSectionComponent]
})
export class InfoModule { }

```

We also need to import `InfoModule` into `HomeModule` otherwise we cannot use
the `InfoSection` component within `landing-page`.

```ts path=src/app/home/home.module.ts
...
import { InfoModule } from "./../info/info.module";
import {
	BreadcrumbModule,
	ButtonModule,
	GridModule,
	TabsModule
} from "carbon-components-angular";

@NgModule({
	declarations: [LandingPageComponent],
	imports: [
		CommonModule,
    ...
		TabsModule,
		InfoModule
	]
})
export class HomeModule { }
```

Now we're going to go into the `InfoSection` component to add content from
`info.json`.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

```ts path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as data from '../info.json';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-info-section',
  templateUrl: './info-section.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./info-section.component.scss'],
})
export class InfoSectionComponent implements OnInit {
  heading = data.title;
  items = data.items;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {}
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}


We essentially have added a `heading` and `items` variable into the model of `InfoSectionComponent`, which we'll be using later to pass content into the children components `InfoCard`.

We've also added class names that are specific to this component that we'll target in our stylesheet:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```scss path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.scss
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography";
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vendor/@carbon/type/scss/font-family";

@mixin info-section-background() {
  background-color: $ui-01;
  position: relative;

  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: -$spacing-05;
    top: 0;
    right: -$spacing-05;
    bottom: 0;
    background: $ui-01;
    z-index: -1;
  }
}

.info-section {
  @include info-section-background;
  display: flex;
  height: fit-content;

  &.info-section__r1 {
    padding-top: $spacing-09;
    padding-bottom: $spacing-09;
    height: auto;
  }

  .info-section__heading {
    @include type-style("heading-01");
    @include font-weight("semibold");
  }
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### InfoCard component

Next up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently
looks like
`<div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">Carbon is Open</div>`. We've
added the data into the parent component but we have not told `info-section`
component to give any data to the `InfoCard` because we first need to tell
`InfoCard` that it will have data to display. In
`src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.html`, add:

```html path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.html
<div class="info-card">
  <h4 class="info-card__heading">{{heading}}</h4>
  <div class="info-card__body">{{content}}</div>
</div>
```

Now we've setup our `InfoCard` to display a heading and some content. We will
setup the component `.ts` file to accept a `heading` and `content` input to be
displayed.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```ts path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-info-card",
  templateUrl: "./info-card.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./info-card.component.scss"],
})
export class InfoCardComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() heading;
  @Input() content;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {}
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Finally, we'll update `InfoSection` to use the new `InfoCard` component.

```html path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.html
<section ibmRow class="info-section info-section__r1">
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">
    <h3 class="info-section__heading">{{heading}}</h3>
  </div>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[0].heading"
    [content]="items[0].content">
  </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[1].heading"
    [content]="items[1].content">
  </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[2].heading"
    [content]="items[2].content">
  </app-info-card>
</section>
```

## Use components

Next we're going to use Carbon Icon components in our custom components. We're
going to place the icons within the `InfoCard` components as children. In the
`InfoModule` we will import the modules we need for the Carbon Angular Icons:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```ts path=src/info/info.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
...

import { PersonFavorite32Module } from "@carbon/icons-angular/lib/person--favorite/32";
import { Globe32Module } from "@carbon/icons-angular/lib/globe/32";
import { Application32Module } from "@carbon/icons-angular/lib/application/32";

import { GridModule } from "carbon-components-angular";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [InfoSectionComponent, InfoCardComponent],
  imports: [
    ...
    PersonFavorite32Module,
    Globe32Module,
    Application32Module,
  ],
  exports: [InfoSectionComponent, InfoCardComponent],
})
export class InfoModule {}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Next we will use `<ng-content>` so that we can inject icons into the `InfoCard`
from it's parent component (`InfoSection`)

```html path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.html
<div class="info-card">
  ...
  <div class="info-card__body">{{content}}</div>
  <div class="info-card__icon">
    <ng-content></ng-content>
  </div>
</div>
```

We also need to update `InfoSection` with the icon components:

```html path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.html
<section ibmRow class="info-section info-section__r1">
  <div ibmCol [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}">
    <h3 class="info-section__heading">{{heading}}</h3>
  </div>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[0].heading"
    [content]="items[0].content">
    <ibm-icon-person-favorite32></ibm-icon-person-favorite32>
  </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[1].heading"
    [content]="items[1].content">
    <ibm-icon-application32></ibm-icon-application32>
  </app-info-card>
  <app-info-card
    ibmCol
    [columnNumbers]="{'md': 4, 'lg': 4}"
    [heading]="items[2].heading"
    [content]="items[2].content">
    <ibm-icon-globe32></ibm-icon-globe32>
  </app-info-card>
</section>
```

## Add styling

We currently have the components displaying the content we created. We need to
add more styling for Carbon breakpoints, icon alignments, as well as the
`InfoCard` title styling.

![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)

### Layout

Starting with layout, add the following to
`src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.scss`.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```scss path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.scss
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography";
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/layout";

.info-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  .info-card__heading {
    @include type-style("productive-heading-03");
  }

  .info-card__body {
    margin-top: $spacing-06;
    flex-grow: 1;
    @include type-style("body-long-01");

    // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports
    @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {
      max-width: 75%;
    }
  }
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Once you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at
the different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.
There are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.

### Type

Our `InfoCard` headings have to be updated to match the specs. We need to make
the last word of each heading bold. Add the below custom function
(`createArrayFromPhrase`) to `src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.ts`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```ts path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: "app-info-card",
  templateUrl: "./info-card.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./info-card.component.scss"],
})
export class InfoCardComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() heading;
  @Input() content;
  splitHeading;

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // create the split title to get bold styles
    this.splitHeading = this.createArrayFromPhrase(this.heading);
  }

  // Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array
  createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {
    const splitPhrase = phrase.split(" ");
    const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();
    return [splitPhrase.join(" "), thirdWord];
  }
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This will allow us to still accept `heading` as an input to the component, but
we'll need to change the template to use `splitHeading` rather than `heading` to
display our heading content.

Update the component template to use `splitHeading`:

```html path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.html
<div class="info-card">
  <h4 class="info-card__heading">
    {{splitHeading[0]}}
    <strong>{{splitHeading[1]}}</strong>
  </h4>
  <div class="info-card__body">{{content}}</div>
  <div class="info-card__icon">
    <ng-content></ng-content>
  </div>
</div>
```

Then, add some styling for the icons within our `InfoCard` component:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```scss path=src/app/info/info-card/info-card.component.scss
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography";
@import "~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/layout";

.info-card {
  ... .info-card__icon {
    margin-top: $spacing-09;
  }
}
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Finally, we need styles for the `InfoCard` borders. We will use the
`InfoSection` to apply styles using the children selectors. Update the
`InfoSection` stylesheet to include styles targeting the `InfoCard`:

```scss path=src/app/info/info-section/info-section.component.scss
.info-section {
  ... app-info-card {
    margin-top: $spacing-09;
  }

  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides
  @include breakpoint-down(md) {
    app-info-card:not(:nth-child(2)) {
      border-top: 1px solid $ui-03;
      padding-top: $spacing-09;
    }
  }

  // left border in just the 2nd column items
  @include breakpoint(md) {
    app-info-card:nth-child(odd) {
      border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;
    }
  }

  // left border in all items
  @include breakpoint(lg) {
    app-info-card {
      margin-top: 0;
      border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;
    }
  }
}
```
