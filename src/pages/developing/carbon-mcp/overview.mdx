## Carbon MCP Public Preview

Carbon MCP is available as a public preview. The Carbon MCP server provides
knowledge on our core Carbon Design System elements, iconography, pictograms,
guidelines, usage documentation, component libraries across React and Web
Components, as well as the Carbon for IBM Products library.

## Model Context Protocol

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard that enables AI agents
or AI applications to securely connect with external tools, data sources, and
workflows through a unified integration layer.

## Why Carbon MCP?

**Instant AI Access to Carbon Design Standards:** Carbon MCP lets AI
applications or agents query the Carbon Design System for colors, typography,
component details, usage guidelines, and other essential context.

**Smarter Code Generation:** Carbon MCP exposes code examples and documentation
that enable AI tools to generate high-fidelity Carbon UI code that follows
design and development best practices.

**Improved Consistency:** Carbon MCP helps designers, developers, and PMs get
consistent answers and examples from a shared source of truth, which reduces
drift and rework.

## MCP tools

Carbon MCP provides these tools to the AI application, which are called as
needed during a session:

`docs_search` Search Carbon Design System and IBM Products documentation,
including component guidance, usage, accessibility, and reference docs.

`code_search` Search Carbon React/Web Components code examples, icons, and
pictograms for complete example application files.
