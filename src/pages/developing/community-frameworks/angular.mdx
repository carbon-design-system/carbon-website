<PageDescription>

The library provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable
Angular components to build websites and user interfaces. Adopting the library
enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype
and production work.

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

The Angular library is maintained by members of the Carbon community. For
support, contact the
[Carbon Angular team](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/new).

v11 upgrade for Carbon Angular is coming soon.

## Install

Assuming we're starting with a new @angular/cli project:

```bash
npx @angular/cli new my-project --style=scss
cd my-project
npm i --save carbon-components-angular carbon-components
```

Then we need to include carbon-components in `src/styles.scss`:

```scss
@import '~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

That's it! Now start the server and start building.

```bash
npm start
```

_Note: This isn't the only way to bootstrap a_ `carbon-components-angular`
_application, but the combination of_ `@angular/cli` _and the_
`carbon-components` _scss is our recommended setup._

### Using our starter app

![carbon-angular-starter screenshot](images/carbon-angular-starter.png)

We recommend using the
[carbon-angular-starter](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter)
for bootstrapping applications with Carbon components. Within five minutes your
app will be running with the following already configured:

- Angular-cli
- Build process
- Code styles and editor configs
- Folder structure
- Lazy loading
- Routing
- Service workers
- Test framework

Check out the
[readme](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter) for
installation instructions.
