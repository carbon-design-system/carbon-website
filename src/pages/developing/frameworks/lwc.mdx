## Getting started

_Coming soon_

## Overview

The LWC carbon component library, formally known as **Carbon for Salesforce
Design System** (C4S), is an IBM internal asset and it should be used for IBM
projects only. We have plans to open source it in the near future.

The design system contains selected components from the Carbon Design System,
Carbon for IBM.com, and Carbon for IBM Products, along with custom components
bespoke to Salesforce platform products.

Within IBM, C4S is used by the Cognitive Support Platform project with
`ibm.com/support` being the client facing experience of IBM Support. We're also
just kicking off the use of C4S on IBM Partner Portal.
