The Carbon for Salesforce team builds and maintains the Lightning Web Components
(LWC) version of Carbon components along with additional custom components. This
library provides front-end developers and engineers a collection of reusable
lightning web components to build websites and user interfaces on the Salesforce
platform.

The LWC components are maintained by the
[Carbon for Salesforce team](https://github.ibm.com/carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce).

## Overview

The LWC carbon component library, formally known as **Carbon for Salesforce
Design System** (C4S), is an IBM internal asset and it should be used for IBM
projects only. We have plans to open source it in the near future.

The design system contains selected components from the Carbon Design System,
Carbon for IBM.com, and Carbon for IBM Products, along with custom components
bespoke to Salesforce platform products.

Within IBM, C4S is used by the Cognitive Support Platform project with
`ibm.com/support` being the client facing experience of IBM Support.

### List of available components

The source code and setup instructions can be found on the
