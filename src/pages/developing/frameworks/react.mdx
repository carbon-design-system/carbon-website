<PageDescription>

The Carbon React library provides front-end developers and engineers a
collection of reusable React components to build websites and user interfaces.
Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and
behavior in prototype and production work.

## Install

<Title> Using npm: </Title>

```bash
npm install --save @carbon/react
```

<Title>
  If you prefer <a href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</a>:
</Title>

```bash
yarn add @carbon/react
```

> **Note:**  
> Please ensure the [peerDependencies](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acarbon-design-system%2Fcarbon+peerDependencies+language%3AJSON+path%3Apackages%2Freact&type=code) for `@carbon/react` are installed in your project to avoid errors.

## Getting started

The `@carbon/react` package provides components, styles and icons for the Carbon
Design System.

Components require the use of a build pipeline in your project. This could be in
the form of a bundler, framework, or other build tool. Some examples include
Next.js, Vite, Parcel, and Webpack. A comprehensive list is available in the
[react documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).

To use a component, you can import it directly from the package:

```js
import { Button } from '@carbon/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Example usage</Button>;
}
```

To include the styles for a specific component, you can either import all the
styles from the project or include the styles for a specific component:

```js
// Bring in all the styles for Carbon in your root/global stylesheet
@use '@carbon/react';

// Or bring in the styles for one component
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/button';
```

### Icons

The @carbon/react package also provides icon components that you can include in
your project. You can import these icon components from the
`@carbon/react/icons` entrypoint:

```js
import { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Add />;
}
```

A full list of available icons is provided in the
[icon library](/elements/icons/library/).

For a more in depth introduction to using `@carbon/react` in a webpack-based
app, [check out our React tutorial](/developing/react-tutorial/overview/).

## Development

Please refer to the
[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before starting any work.

### Using the server

We use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) for developing
components.

<Title> Start the server: </Title>

```bash
yarn storybook
```

2.  Open browser to `http://localhost:9000/`.

3.  Develop components in their respective folders (`/components` or
    `/internal`).

4.  Author stories within the `*.stories.js*` files.

### List of available components

View available React Components in
[the `@carbon/react` storybook](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com). Usage
information is available under the "docs" tab.

## Troubleshooting
