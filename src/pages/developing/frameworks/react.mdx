<PageDescription>

The Carbon React library provides front-end developers and engineers a
collection of reusable React components to build websites and user interfaces.
Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and
behavior in prototype and production work.

## Install

<InlineNotification>

**`@carbon/react` is new for v11.** It houses all the components, styles, and
icons within a single package. It replaces the need for `carbon-components`,
`carbon-components-react`, `carbon-icons`, and `@carbon/icons-react` packages.

It also includes the bulk of everything you should need from other Carbon
packages including `@carbon/styles`, `@carbon/grid`, `@carbon/layout`,
`@carbon/themes`, `@carbon/type`, etc.

We recommend starting with `@carbon/react` and not installing other Carbon
packages until you find it necessary.

Full details are available in the [migration guide](/migrating/guide/develop)
and the
[v11 changelog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md).

<Title> Using npm: </Title>

```bash
npm install @carbon/react --save
```

<Title>
  If you prefer <a href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</a>:
</Title>

```bash
yarn add @carbon/react
```

## Getting started

1.  These components require the use of
    [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/), or a similar
    module bundler such as Vite, in your project.

2.  Components do not import any of the styles themselves. Styles are provided
    through `@carbon/react` as
    [Sass modules](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched).
    You will likely need to install the
    [Dart Sass](https://npmjs.com/package/sass) package.

```bash
npm install sass --save-dev

// or via yarn:
yarn add sass --dev
```

3.  Once `sass` is added and configured, `@use` the SCSS to bring in styling
    within an `index.scss`.

```scss path=./index.scss
@use '@carbon/react';
```

4. In most cases you'll need to import this file within the root file of your
   app

```jsx path=./main.jsx
import './index.scss';

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

4. Import components and begin building!

```jsx path=./App.jsx
import { Button } from '@carbon/react';
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Hello world</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Development

Please refer to the
[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before starting any work.

### Using the server

We recommend the use of
[React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook) for developing
components.

<Title> Start the server: </Title>

```bash
yarn storybook
```

2.  Open browser to `http://localhost:9000/`.

3.  Develop components in their respective folders (`/components` or
    `/internal`).

4.  Write stories for your components in `/.storybook`.

### List of available components

View available React Components [here](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com).
Usage information is available when you select "Docs".

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues while getting set up with `@carbon/react`, please
head over to the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10/packages/react)
for more guidelines and support. Please
[create an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) if your
issue does not already exist.
