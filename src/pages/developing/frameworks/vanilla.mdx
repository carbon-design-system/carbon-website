### CDN

Use unpkg for easy access to our built static files. This is great for
prototyping and trying `carbon-components` without installing anything. See all
files from `carbon-components` available on
[unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/carbon-components/).

| Scripts | URL                                                                  |

| ES5     | https://unpkg.com/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js |

### CodePen

We have individual [CodePens](https://codepen.io/collection/XqRbEz/) for all of
our components which you can easily fork and play around with.

### SCSS

Using the Carbon Sass files infers usage of the SCSS pre-processor. All Sass
files use the `*.scss` file extension.

For transpiling Sass code, use `node-sass` based Sass compilers, for example,
WebPack `sass-loader` or `gulp-sass`.

If you're starting a new project without a boilerplate, you need to know about a
few things to get started.

#### Autoprefixer

Make sure your build process uses
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to ensure vendor
prefixes are automatically added to your output CSS.

#### Default body styles

CSS is automatically applied to `<body>` element, which comes from
[\_css--body.scss](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/components/src/globals/scss/_css--body.scss).
These styles are meant to cascade down to everything in `<body>` to set common
styles shared across all components.

```scss
body {
  @include reset;
  @include type-style('body-short-01');
  color: $text-01;
  background-color: $ui-background;
  line-height: 1;
}
```

#### Icons

A lot of components depend on SVG icons from
[carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons). Read the
[docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/blob/master/docs/usage.md)
for details on how to use them.

#### Global SCSS variables

These variables are used to configure which parts of the SCSS get compiled,
where each variable controls a SCSS file of the same name. All variables are set
to `true` by default.

For example:

- When you set `$css--reset: true`, then the contents of
  [\_css--reset.scss](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/src/globals/scss/_css--reset.scss)
  will be part of your output CSS.
- When you set `$css--reset: false`, then nothing gets included from that SCSS
  file.
- When the variable is not declared at all, then nothing gets included from that
  SCSS file.

The same rules apply to all the following variables:

```scss
// In styles.scss:
// These are the default settings.
$css--font-face: true !default;
$css--helpers: true !default;
$css--body: true !default;
$css--use-layer: true !default;
$css--reset: true !default;
$css--typography: true !default;
$css--plex: true !default;
```

These flags are set for you by default when you `@import` the `styles.scss`
file. You can override these default settings by redeclaring the variables.

#### Importing SCSS files

To add a component style to your build, simply import the component directly.
Importing a component this way will bring in any dependencies that component has
as well. The import system removes duplicate dependencies, so shared
dependencies between components will not create extra CSS.

```js
@import 'node_modules/carbon-components/scss/components/card/card';
```

#### Namespacing

Carbon Components are built to be included individually and not clobber global
styles - all `class` attributes are prefixed by the `bx--` moniker. You can
specify your own prefix by changing the SCSS variable `$prefix`.

### JavaScript

Carbon Component has component JavaScript classes, each of which correspond to a
component found in [our components page](/components/overview). The first steps
to work with component JavaScript classes are the following:

#### 1. Getting component JavaScript class reference

<br />

**Using a module bundler:** We recommend using ECMAScript module along with your
module bundler toolchain to do so. Using a module bundler will bring in only the
component code your application needs, creating an optimized build for
production. Carbon Components ships with a ECMAScript module build as well as
UMD build for each component, for use with webpack or Rollup.

After you've installed the components through `npm`, you can grab a component
JavaScript class reference by something like this:

```js
import { Modal } from 'carbon-components';
```

**Using pre-built bundle:** Users can also opt to use the pre-built
`carbon-components.js` file directly, like below. We recommend that most users
do _not_ use this file, as it includes components your application may or may
not actually be using.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Put HTML snippets of components here... -->
    <script src="node_modules/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Once you load `carbon-components.js` via `<script>` tag, you can grab a
component JavaScript class reference by something like this:

```js
var Modal = CarbonComponents.Modal;
```

_Note: By default, pre-built bundle automatically instantiates all components on
the page when_ `DOMContentLoaded` _event on the page fires. In case you don't
want that behavior, you can set_
`CarbonComponents.settings.disableAutoInit = true` _right after_
`carbon-components.js` _is loaded._

_Caveat: Don't use pre-built_ `carbon-components.js` _if you are importing
components via ECMAScript module syntax. Doing so will cause Carbon code loaded
twice, often competing each other._

#### 2. Instantiating component class on DOM nodes

Once you have a
[component JavaScript class reference](#1-getting-component-javascript-class-reference),
you can instantiate it on a DOM node with the `.create()` API.

For example, if you have the following HTML for modal:

```html
<div data-modal id="modal-nofooter" class="bx--modal" tabindex="-1">
  <div class="bx--modal-container">...</div>
</div>
```

You can create and get the instance by:

```js
const modalElement = document.getElementById('modal-nofooter');
const modalInstance = Modal.create(modalElement);
```

_Note: The DOM element to instantiate components on typically has a
`data-componentname` attribute, e.g. `data-modal` for modal._

Instantiating a component basically does two things:

- Hooks several event handlers on some DOM elements inside (in above example,
  ones in `modalElement`, e.g. close button)
- Allows you to access public methods (found in
  [our components page](../../components/overview), e.g.
  [here](/components/modal/code#public-methods) for modal) via the instance
  reference (`modalInstance.show()`, etc. in above example)

#### Higher-level component instantiation API

While `.create()` API gives you the full control of component instantiation,
there is a higher-level API for instantiating components, which is,
`.init(rootElement)`. It instantiates all components with `data-componentname`
attribute (e.g. `data-modal` for modal) inside the given `rootElement`. If
`rootElement` is omitted, `document` is used.

_Note:_ `.init()` _API does not take care of DOM elements that hasn't been
available at the time it's called. If the JavaScript framework you are using
creates DOM elements dynamically, follow the instructions in the next section
instead of using_ `.init()`.

#### Wrapping a component with JavaScript framework of your choice

Many JavaScript frameworks have a mechanism to dynamically create/destroy DOM
elements, for example, upon change in array. This often makes it unclear when
the DOM element to instantiate Carbon component on is available, which often
depends on the JavaScript framework you use.

Also when DOM elements that Carbon components have been instantiated on are
being destroyed, the Carbon component instances should be released so that e.g.
there are no zombie event handlers.

The easiest way to hook on the creation/destroy of DOM elements is defining a
"wrapping component", with the JavaScript framework of your choice. Here's an
example using Web Components'
[Custom Elements v1 spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements),
but the notion of components, along with the lifecycle callbacks, are commonly
found in many other JavaScript frameworks.

```javascript
class BXLoading extends HTMLElement {
  // Called when this custom element gets into render tree
  connectedCallback() {
    // "this" here is "<bx-loading>" element
    this.innerHTML =
      '(e.g. snippet from http://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/code)';
    this.loading = CarbonComponents.Loading.create(
      this.querySelector('[data-loading]')
    );
  }
  // Called when this custom element gets out of render tree
  disconnectedCallback() {
    this.loading.release();
  }
}
customElements.define('bx-loading', BXLoading);
```

### Polyfills for older browsers

carbon-components requires some polyfills for older browsers, in addition to
carbon-components.js (or carbon-components.min.js). The latest list of polyfills
is maintained in
[carbon-components/blog/master/packages/components/demo/polyfills/index.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/components/demo/polyfills/index.js).
You can easily find the polyfills in NPM, etc. The current list is below:

- [Array.from()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)
- [Math.sign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sign)
- [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
- [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent)
- [Element#closest()](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
- [Element#matches()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches)
- [2nd arg of Element.classList.toggle()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList#Methods)
