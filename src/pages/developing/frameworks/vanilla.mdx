<PageDescription>

The library provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable
HTML and SCSS partials to build websites and user interfaces. Adopting the
library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in
prototype and production work.

<InlineNotification>

The vanilla JS library is maintained by members of the Carbon community. Vanilla
JS is only supported in v10. Please visit our
[v10 documentation](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/vanilla)
for more info. For support,
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).

## Getting started

### SCSS

As of v11, Carbon only provides
[styles](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles)
for Vanilla JS.

A minified css bundle is not included, you'll need to add sass compiliation to
your project's build to use v11.

If you were previously using `carbon-components`, the styles from this package
are available under `@carbon/styles`. The `carbon-components` packages will
stick around in v11 but will only be a re-export of `@carbon/styles`.

For additional information on using sass for v11. Please follow the
[scss migration guide](https://carbondesignsystem.com/migrating/guide/develop#step-2:-styles-and-dart-sass)

#### Autoprefixer

Make sure your build process uses
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to ensure vendor
prefixes are automatically added to your output CSS.

#### Namespacing

Carbon Components are built to be included individually and not clobber global
styles - all `class` attributes are prefixed by the `cds--` moniker. You can
specify your own prefix by changing the SCSS variable `$prefix`.

## Legacy

### CodePen

We have individual [CodePens](https://codepen.io/collection/XqRbEz/) for all of
our v10 components which you can easily fork and play around with.
