## First steps

### Install your framework of choice

The Carbon Design System is built with official support for React and Web
Components. Community support exists for other frameworks like Angular, vanilla
JS, Vue, Svelte, and Lightning Web Components. Head over to
[Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) for all the information you need to
get started.

### Check out our developer resources

In [Developer resources](/developing/dev-resources/resources/), you’ll find
Carbon tools, as well as our GitHub repos and Storybooks for your framework of
choice.

### Learn the basic concepts of Carbon

The [introduction section](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon/) helps to make sense of how Carbon is built and why.

#### Learn about the IBM Design Language

Carbon expresses the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
in product and delivers it through tools for designers and developers including
guidance, tooling, components, and support. Take the time to read the site so
that you fully understand what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles,
and can make informed decisions in your product work.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
Understanding the concepts of the IBM Design Language will save you lots
of unnecessary code (especially CSS), will make your implementation faster
to implement and faster to upgrade. Don't skip this step.

#### Learn how Carbon implements the IBM Design Language

The elements are essential to know for using Carbon right.
