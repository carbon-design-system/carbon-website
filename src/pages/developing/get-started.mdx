## First steps

### Install your framework of choice

The Carbon Design System is built React first, with official support for Web
Components. We also support core parts of the system in vanilla JS, Angular,
Vue, and Svelte and offer guidelines for other frameworks. Head over to
[Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) for all the information you need to
get started.

### Check out our developer resources

In [Developer resources](/developing/dev-resources), you’ll find Carbon tools,
as well as our GitHub repos and Storybooks for your framework of choice.

## Additional guidance

### Take a tutorial

We offer tutorials in Angular, React, and Vue to guide you in creating an app
with the Carbon Design System. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of using Carbon
components, and introduce web development best practices along the way.

### Learn about the IBM Design Language

Carbon expresses the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
in product and delivers it through tools for designers and developers including
guidance, tooling, components, and support. Take the time to read the site so
that you fully understand what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles,
and can make informed decisions in your product work.

## Connect with us

### Join us and the Carbon community

_For internal IBM only_: If you have a question about any aspect of the
frameworks or tools, you can reach out to us on Slack and use that as a way to
