## First steps

### Install your framework of choice

The Carbon Design System is built React first. We also support core parts of the
system in vanilla JS, Angular, Vue, and Svelte and offer guidelines for other
frameworks. Head over to [Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) for all the
information you need to get started.

### Check out our developer resources

In [Developer resources](/developing/dev-resources), you’ll find Carbon tools,
as well as our GitHub repos and Storybooks for your framework of choice.

## Additional guidance

### Take a tutorial, earn a badge

We offer tutorials in Angular, React, and Vue to guide you in creating an app
with the Carbon Design System. We’ll teach you the ins and outs of using Carbon
components, and introduce web development best practices along the way. Everyone
who completes the tutorial will earn an IBM digital badge.

### Learn about the IBM Design Language

Carbon expresses the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
in product and delivers it through tools for designers and developers including
guidance, tooling, components, and support. Take the time to read the site so
that you fully understand what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles,
and can make informed decisions in your product work.

## Connect with us
