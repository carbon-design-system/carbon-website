This step takes what we've built so far and optimizes the app for a production
environment. We'll be deploying the production build to
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Preview

A [preview](https://carbon-tutorial-nextjs.vercel.app/) of what you'll build
(visually no different, but built for production):

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-next-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/next-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b v11-next-step-5 upstream/v11-next-step-5
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 4, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 5 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current
directory and not continuing from the previous step):

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/next-tutorial/step-4) left off.

## Build for production

Before we deploy our app, we need to create an optimized production build with
this command. You may need to `CTRL-C` to stop the development environment
first.

```bash
yarn build
```

Looking at `package.json`, you'll find `yarn build` to run `next build`. This
builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles NextJS in
production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. It even goes
so far to minify files and include hashes in filenames for caching.

As a lot of this may seem like magic since the build configuration came from
Create Next App, go ahead and check out their
[going to production checklist](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/production-checklist)
for a full description of what's happening.

## Deploying to Vercel

Next we'll be deploying to
[Vercel](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy) which
allows you to host your files directly from your repository in GitHub.

Watch or read the instructions below:

/>

First go to your Dashboard on Vercel and click on "Add New" then "Project".
After that you will have to find the the repository you have forked, probably
called `carbon-tutorial-nextjs` and import. Once you found the repository you
just have to click on "Deploy" and wait for the project to build.

**Note:** Can't find the repository? Make sure Vercel has access to your Github

Once the project was successfully deployed, we will need to select which branch
we want to use in production, by default is the `main` branch, but for this
tutorial we are going to use the `v11-next-step-5`.

On your project page, go to Settings -> Git, then look for "Production Branch"
and change the name from `main` to `v11-next-step-5`.

This change will not take effect until after the next commit to the branch, so
once the build is complete, you will need to go to the `v11-next-step-5` branch
and make a change, then push it to GitHub.

Congratulations! Your work is now hosted on Vercel
