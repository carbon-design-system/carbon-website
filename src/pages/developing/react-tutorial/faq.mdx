### I am getting an error that says <span className='tutorial-faq-header-code'>`failed to find manifest for cf`</span>. What do I do?

- The 5th step assumes your spaces are in the US South region. To successfully
  deploy, you might need to update the region code (e.g.
  `api.[REGION].cf.cloud.ibm.com`) to the region where your spaces were created,
  or create a space in the US South region.

- If you don't have an org, create one
  [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/cloud-foundry).
  - In the top nav go to Manage > Account > Account resources > Cloud Foundry
    orgs
  - The name you give it doesn't matter, just take note of the region you
    select, and use that region's API endpoint (e.g.
    `api.[REGION].cf.cloud.ibm.com`)
  - Find regions and endpoints
    [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-endpoints).

### I am getting an error that says <span className='tutorial-faq-header-code'>`yarn lockfile missing`</span>. How do I fix this?

- This error can occur when the `yarn.lock` file is either missing or differs
  from the one used in the tutorial step. To fix this, you can go to the Github
  branch for the step you are on, find the `yarn.lock` file, and copy that file
  into your working directory. You may need to delete your `node_modules` folder
  and run `yarn` afterwards.

### I am getting a <span className='tutorial-faq-header-code'>`yarn offline cache`</span> error. How do I fix this?

- Try running
  `rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`
  and push up any changes. If this still does not work, ensure your `yarn.lock`
  file matches the one at the start of the tutorial step

### When will my PR be reviewed?

- If your PR is passing, it will automatically get approved and closed by a bot.

### Other troubleshooting tips

- We updated the `react-scripts` dependency to `v5.0.1`. Pull from `upstream`
  and run `yarn` or `npm install` to update your remote branch.
- You no longer need the `.env` with the updated `react-scripts` dependency. If
  you are up to date, you can delete that file (previously at the root level).
- Run `yarn format` and commit any changes made.
