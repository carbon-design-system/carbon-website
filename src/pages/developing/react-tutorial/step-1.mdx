Starting with Create React App, let's install Carbon and begin using Carbon
components. By the end you will have a React app that uses the UI Shell to
navigate between pages.

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) that
we'll use as a starting point for each step.

### Fork

To begin, fork
[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) using
your GitHub account.

### Clone

Go to your forked repository, copy the SSH or HTTPS URL and in your terminal run
the two commands to get the repository in your local file system and enter that
directory.

```bash
git clone [your fork SSH/HTTPS]
cd carbon-tutorial
```

### Add upstream remote

Add a remote called `upstream` so we can eventually submit a pull request once
you have completed this tutorial step. There are two choices: SSH or HTTPS

#### SSH

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git
```

#### HTTPS

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git
```

Verify that your forked repository remotes are correct:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Your terminal should output something like this:

```bash
origin	[your forked repo] (fetch)
origin	[your forked repo] (push)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git (push)
```

### Branch

Now that we have our repository set up, let's check out the branch for this
tutorial step's starting point. Run the two commands:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b v11-react-step-1 upstream/v11-react-step-1
```

## Build and start

We have the repository forked to your GitHub account, cloned down to your
machine, and the starting branch checked out. Next, install the React app's
dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with:

```bash
yarn start
```

Your default browser should open up with an empty page that says:
`Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon tutorial.`

## Install Carbon

Even though we installed existing dependencies, we've yet to install our v11
Carbon package, `@carbon/react`, which contains everything you need to build
with.

Stop your development server with `CTRL-C` and install Carbon dependencies with:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/react@1.1.0
```

## Install and build Sass

We need to run a Sass build as the Carbon styles are authored in Sass, so run
the following command to install `sass` as a dependency.

```bash
yarn add sass@1.51.0
```

Then, start the app again. If your app's currently running, you'll need to
restart it for the new environment variable to be used.

```bash
yarn start
```

The app looks as it did before. Next, let's prepare our app for a Sass build.

In the `src` directory, rename `index.css` as `index.scss`. Then in `index.js`
update the `index.css` import to `index.scss`.

### Import carbon-component styles

In `index.scss`, import the Carbon styles by adding the following at the top of
the file:

```scss path=src/index.scss
@use '@carbon/react';
```

Making this change to `index.scss` will cause all of the Carbon Sass to
re-compile. Once finished re-compiling the Carbon base styling is applied (IBM
Plex Sans font family, font size, weight, colors, etc.)

Re-compiling all of the Carbon Sass takes a while, even on fast systems. Let's
speed this up by moving our custom app Sass into a separate file, `app.scss` in
the 'src' directory, and import that from `App.js`.

```javascript path=src/App.js
import './app.scss';
```

By modifying `index.scss` as little as possible and storing all app-specific
styling in `app.scss` we will make compile times much quicker. Storing the
app-specific styling in a separate file also makes good organizational sense.

Next, we'll import a `Button` from Carbon to test that our dependencies are
working properly. At the top of `App.js`, import the `Button` by adding the
following:

```javascript path=src/App.js
import { Button } from '@carbon/react';
```

In the `App` component return, you can now replace:

```html path=src/App.js
<div>
  Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon
  tutorial.
</div>
```

with:

```jsx path=src/App.js
<Button>Button</Button>
```

Congratulations, you've imported your first component! You should see a Carbon
styled button on the page.

## Add UI Shell

Next, we're going to create a React component called `TutorialHeader` to use
with the UI Shell Carbon component. In the `src` directory, create a
`components` directory and inside of that, a `TutorialHeader` directory. Create
the following files inside `src/components/TutorialHeader`:

```bash
src/components/TutorialHeader
├──_tutorial-header.scss
├──index.js
└──TutorialHeader.js
```

### Add UI Shell Sass

Next, in `app.scss`, we'll import our `TutorialHeader` styles. Your file should
now look like this:

```scss path=src/app.scss
@use './components/TutorialHeader/tutorial-header';
```

### Import and export the header

In `src/components/TutorialHeader/index.js`, import and export our
`TutorialHeader` component like so:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/index.js
import TutorialHeader from './TutorialHeader';
export default TutorialHeader;
```

Next we'll import our Carbon UI Shell components into `TutorialHeader.js`. Set
up the file like so:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
import React from 'react';
import {
  Header,
  HeaderContainer,
  HeaderName,
  HeaderNavigation,
  HeaderMenuButton,
  HeaderMenuItem,
  HeaderGlobalBar,
  HeaderGlobalAction,
  SkipToContent,
  SideNav,
  SideNavItems,
  HeaderSideNavItems,
} from '@carbon/react';

const TutorialHeader = () => (
  <HeaderContainer
    render={({ isSideNavExpanded, onClickSideNavExpand }) => (
      <Header aria-label="Carbon Tutorial">
        <SkipToContent />
        <HeaderMenuButton
          aria-label="Open menu"
          onClick={onClickSideNavExpand}
          isActive={isSideNavExpanded}
        />
        <HeaderName href="/" prefix="IBM">
          Carbon Tutorial
        </HeaderName>
        <HeaderNavigation aria-label="Carbon Tutorial">
          <HeaderMenuItem href="/repos">Repositories</HeaderMenuItem>
        </HeaderNavigation>
        <SideNav
          aria-label="Side navigation"
          expanded={isSideNavExpanded}
          isPersistent={false}
        >
          <SideNavItems>
            <HeaderSideNavItems>
              <HeaderMenuItem href="/repos">Repositories</HeaderMenuItem>
            </HeaderSideNavItems>
          </SideNavItems>
        </SideNav>
        <HeaderGlobalBar />
      </Header>
    )}
  />
);

export default TutorialHeader;
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** you can find a description of the different components used in the UI
Shell in our
[@carbon/react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/UIShell)
package.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** When creating navigation headers, it's important to have a
`Skip to content` link so keyboard users can skip the navigation items and go
straight to the main content.

</InlineNotification>

### Import icons

Now let's import the icons. In the `TutorialHeader.js` file, we need to import
each individual icon we will use.

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
import { Switcher, Notification, UserAvatar } from '@carbon/react/icons';
```

Then we need to add the `HeaderGlobalAction` component inside of the
`HeaderGlobalBar` where we will add our icons. These represent actions in the
header a user can make. Replace:

```html path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
<HeaderGlobalBar />
```

With:

```jsx path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
<HeaderGlobalBar>
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="Notifications" tooltipAlignment="center">
    <Notification size={20} />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="User Avatar" tooltipAlignment="center">
    <UserAvatar size={20} />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="App Switcher" tooltipAlignment="end">
    <Switcher size={20} />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
</HeaderGlobalBar>
```

### Render the header

Next we'll render our UI Shell by importing our `TutorialHeader` component and
`Content` into `App.js`. Your imports should look like this:

```javascript path=src/App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './app.scss';
import { Button, Content } from '@carbon/react';
import TutorialHeader from './components/TutorialHeader';
```

Our `return` currently just contains a `Button`. Let's update that to include
our imported components. This should look like the following:

```javascript path=src/App.js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <TutorialHeader />
        <Content>
          <Button>Button</Button>
        </Content>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

You should now see a styled UI Shell header and a button below it.

## Create pages

Next thing we need to do is create the files for our content. Start by creating
a folder called `content` in `src`. This should be a sibling of
`src/components`.

Since our app will have two pages, we'll create two folders in `src/content`.

```bash
src/content
├── LandingPage
└── RepoPage
```

Next, we'll set up these folders the same way we set up
`src/components/TutorialHeader`.

Create the following files in the `LandingPage` folder:

```bash
src/content/LandingPage
├── _landing-page.scss
├── index.js
└── LandingPage.js
```

Create the following files in the `RepoPage` folder:

```bash
src/content/RepoPage
├── _repo-page.scss
├── index.js
└── RepoPage.js
```

### Set up content Sass

Next, we'll import our content Sass files in `app.scss`, like so:

```scss path=src/app.scss
@use './components/TutorialHeader/tutorial-header';
@use './content/LandingPage/landing-page';
@use './content/RepoPage/repo-page';
```

### Import and export content pages

Now that our stylesheets are set up, we need to create our pages' components.
Starting with `LandingPage`, just like with our header, we need to export the
component in `src/content/LandingPage/index.js` by adding:

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/index.js
import LandingPage from './LandingPage';
export default LandingPage;
```

Next in `LandingPage.js`, we'll create our component.

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
import React from 'react';

const LandingPage = () => {
  return <div>LANDING PAGE</div>;
};

export default LandingPage;
```

We'll repeat this process with `RepoPage`.

In `src/content/RepoPage/index.js`, import and export the `RepoPage` component
like so:

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/index.js
import RepoPage from './RepoPage';
export default RepoPage;
```

Then in `RepoPage.js` create the component.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import React from 'react';

const RepoPage = () => {
  return <div>REPO PAGE</div>;
};

export default RepoPage;
```

Awesome! We've just created our content pages. Next thing we need to do is
render them with our router.

## Add routing

We've updated our app to render our header, but now we need to add routing
functionality. To do this we need to install `react-router-dom`. Go ahead and
stop your development server (with `CTRL-C`) and then:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom@5.0.0
yarn start
```

First, we need to wrap our app in the `Router` component. In the root
`index.js`, add the import:

```javascript path=src/index.js
import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We're using `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` to simplify
deployments in upcoming tutorial steps. Learn more about the React Router
[here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter).

</InlineNotification>

Then, update the `render()` function to include the `Router`.

```javascript path=src/index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In order to render our content pages, we need to add the following imports in
`App.js` below our existing imports.

```javascript path=src/App.js
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import LandingPage from './content/LandingPage';
import RepoPage from './content/RepoPage';
```

This allows us to use our page content components and routing components from
`react-router-dom`.

The next thing we need to do is update what we're returning to `App.js`. We
currently just have a button in our content. In order to render our pages
correctly, we need to delete the `Button` component within `Content` (and remove
the Button import).

Now inside `Content` we'll add the following:

```jsx path=src/App.js
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
  <Route path="/repos" component={RepoPage} />
</Switch>
```

After that we need to do a couple quick fixes to the UI Shell to have it work
with the React router.

Add the `Link` import in `TutorialHeader.js`:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

We need to use the `Link` component instead of the default anchor elements to
prevent full page reload when navigating to different pages with React Router.
To use `Link`, update the `HeaderName` component to use the `element` prop and
replace the `href` with `to`:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
<HeaderName element={Link} to="/" prefix="IBM">
  Carbon Tutorial
</HeaderName>
```

Do the same with the components that contain `href="/repos"`, updating them to:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js
<HeaderMenuItem element={Link} to="/repos">
  Repositories
</HeaderMenuItem>
```

You should now have a working header that routes to different pages without full
page reload! However, our page does not match the design specs. We need to
change the header theme to `g100` to match the specs.

In `App.js` we will add inline theming for our navigation. First, we need to
import our new `Theme` component.

```javascript path=src/App.js
import { Content, Theme } from '@carbon/react';
```

Then, we will wrap `Theme` around our header, and set the zoned theme using the
`theme` prop, which accepts one of four strings: `"white"`, `"g10"`, `"g90"` or
`"g100"`.

```javascript path=src/App.js
<>
  <Theme theme="g100">
    <TutorialHeader />
  </Theme>
  <Content>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
      <Route path="/repos" component={RepoPage} />
    </Switch>
  </Content>
</>
```

You might have noticed that the landing and repo page content disappeared. This
is because we now have a wrapper around the UI Shell, and the spacing is off. To
fix this, we'll add the following override in `index.scss` below our style
import:

```scss path=src/index.scss
.cds--content {
  margin-top: 3rem;
}
```

We have one last thing to fix before we're done. Because we changed the header
theme to dark, the `<HeaderGlobalAction>` tooltips are now light instead of
dark, and when you scroll the page, it blends into the content. To fix this,
we'll add some overriding styles in `_tutorial-header.scss`:

```scss path=src/components/TutorialHeader/_tutorial-header.scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/colors';

// overriding header tooltip bg color
// because the navigation is dark themed while the content is white
// which means the dark theme tooltip bg blends into the white content bg
.cds--header__global .cds--popover-content {
  background-color: colors.$gray-20;
}

.cds--header__global .cds--popover-caret {
  background-color: colors.$gray-20;
}
```

## Submit pull request

We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step
and demonstrate a couple of related concepts.

### Continuous integration (CI) check

We have a `ci-check` script defined in `package.json` that verifies file
formatting for files that have been touched since the last Git commit with a
tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io). You'd typically also have that
script run your test suite as part of your CI build. Go ahead and make sure
everything looks good with:

```bash
yarn ci-check
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If the `ci-check` is giving an error, it's likely that some of your
source files are not properly formatted. This could happen if your text editor
isn't formatting with Prettier on save. To get `ci-check` to pass, run
`yarn format` then re-run `yarn ci-check`.

</InlineNotification>

### Git commit and push

Before we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat(tutorial): complete step 1"
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You'll notice that your commit includes binaries in the `.yarn/cache`
folder. That's expected as the repository is configured to run
[Yarn offline](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/offline-mirror) for more
reliable builds. Future tutorial steps that don't install new packages won't
have `.yarn/cache` commit changes.

</InlineNotification>

Then, push to your repository:

```bash
git push origin v11-react-step-1
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If your Git remote protocol is HTTPS instead of SSH, you may be
prompted to authenticate with GitHub when you push changes. If your GitHub
account has two-factor authentication enabled, we recommend that you follow
these instructions to
[create a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
That lets you use your token instead of password when performing Git operations
over HTTPS.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If you receive a `non-fast-forward` error, it's likely that your
forked repository is behind the original repository and needs to be updated.
This can happen if the tutorial was updated after you began working on it. To
fix, run `git pull upstream v11-react-step-1` to merge the changes into your
branch, then you can try pushing again. Or, you can
[manually merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) in the
upstream changes.

</InlineNotification>

### Pull request (PR)

Finally, visit
[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to
"Compare & pull request". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to
`v11-react-step-1` into `base: v11-react-step-1`. Take notice of the
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) bot that deploys a preview of your PR every
time that you push new commits. These previews can be shared and viewed by
anybody to assist the PR review process.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but
not merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches
pristine and ready for the next person!

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If your PR fails the CircleCI test with the error
`Can't make a request in offline mode`, try running the following command:
`rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`.
Add and commit the changes once this completes, and try pushing again.
