Now that we have a React app using the UI Shell, it's time to build a few static
pages. In this step, we'll become comfortable with the Carbon grid and various
Carbon components.

## Preview

A [preview](https://react-step-3--carbon-tutorial.netlify.com) of what you'll
build:

/>

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) that
we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and cloned
that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and do so
by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b react-step-2 upstream/react-step-2
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 1, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 2 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

</InlineNotification>

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current
directory and not continuing from the previous step):

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1) left off.

### IE11 polyfills

Before we get started with this step, we'll be adding some components that
require IE11 polyfills. As shown in the
[Carbon React documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js),
go ahead and add these imports to the top of the root `index.js`. They aren't
all needed, but we'll add them all to play it safe for the duration of the
tutorial.

```javascript path=src/index.js
import 'core-js/modules/es7.array.includes';
import 'core-js/modules/es6.array.fill';
import 'core-js/modules/es6.string.includes';
import 'core-js/modules/es6.string.trim';
import 'core-js/modules/es7.object.values';
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You may be wondering where `core-js`came from because it's not a
Carbon package and we haven't explicitly installed it. Run `yarn why core-js`
and you'll see there are a number of packages that have brought it in as a
dependency.

</InlineNotification>

## Install grid

In our last step we added our styles, component and icon packages. Now that
we're building the pages with grid, we need to install one more Carbon package.
Stop your development environment (`CTRL-C`) and:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/grid
```

In `index.scss`, we need to configure our grid to use 16 columns instead of the
default 12 columns. We do this by adding `grid-columns-16: true` in our
`$feature-flags`.

```scss path=src/index.scss
$feature-flags: (
  ui-shell: true,
  grid-columns-16: true,
);
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Like before, the feature flag still needs to come before the Carbon
`styles.scss` import.

</InlineNotification>

Run `yarn start` so we can begin building.

## Add landing page grid

Let's add our grid elements to `LandingPage.js`.

In order to use the grid, we need to wrap everything in a
`<div className="bx--grid">`. We can continue to make rows by adding a
`<div className="bx--row">` inside the grid, as well as make columns within
those rows by adding `<div className="bx--col-[breakpoint]-[size]">`.

Our column sizes are specified by the number of columns they'll be spanning. If
we use `bx--col-lg-4`, it means it'll span 4 of the 16 columns. If we use
`bx--col-lg-8` it means it'll span 8 of the 16 columns, and so on.

We've included the designs for this tutorial app in the `design.sketch` file
found as a top-level file in the `carbon-tutorial` repository. But, if you don't
have Sketch installed and available to inspect the design, we'll provide
screenshots.

![Landing page grid](../shared/step-2/images/landing-layout.png)

<Caption>Landing page grid</Caption>

<InlineNotification>

**Pro tip:** `CTRL-L` toggles the layout in Sketch.

</InlineNotification>

We'll break this down into three rows. The first row with the gray background
doesn't appear to need any columns. The second row with the white background
looks like it has two columns of different widths. The third row with the gray
background looks like it has four columns of equal width.

We'll make rows like so:

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
return (
  <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--full-width landing-page">
    <div className="bx--row landing-page__banner">
      <div className="bx--col-lg-16">1</div>
    </div>
    <div className="bx--row landing-page__r2">
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-7">7/16</div>
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--offset-lg-1 bx--col-lg-8">8/16</div>
    </div>
    <div className="bx--row landing-page__r3">
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">1/4</div>
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">1/4</div>
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">1/4</div>
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">1/4</div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

We added a class of `bx--grid--full-width` to the grid container since our rows
need to expand the whole page without any margins. We also added some custom
classes like `landing-page`, `landing-page__banner`, `landing-page__r2`, etc.,
which we will use later.

Also, take notice of the second row. The tab content only covers 7 columns at
this large viewport to prevent overly-large line lengths, so we needed to add a
1 column offset `bx--offset-lg-1` to second column to fill the full 16 columns
in the grid. Then, both of those columns have `bx--col-md-4` classes so they are
of equal width at medium-sized viewports.

## Build landing page

We'll start adding HTML elements and components by row.

### First row

In our first row we'll need a `BreadCrumb` component. First, let's import the
components we need. Because we'll be importing several components for this page,
we'll import them directly from the `carbon-components-react` package instead of
the direct path for each one.

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

We can now add our component to the first row, along with a header, like so:

```html path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
<div className="bx--row landing-page__banner">
  <div className="bx--col-lg-16">
    <Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash>
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <a href="/">Getting started</a>
      </BreadcrumbItem>
    </Breadcrumb>
    <h1 className="landing-page__heading">
      Design &amp; build with Carbon
    </h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

You may notice that the styles look off. Don't worry, we'll fix these later.

### Second row

In our second row we'll need `Tabs` and `Button` components. We'll update the
`carbon-components-react` import to:

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
import {
  Breadcrumb,
  BreadcrumbItem,
  Button,
  Tabs,
  Tab,
} from 'carbon-components-react';
```

Before we can render the tabs, we need to add some props for the component after
the import. These example props came from the
[React Tabs Story](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=Tabs) in
Storybook.

```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
const props = {
  tabs: {
    selected: 0,
    triggerHref: '#',
    role: 'navigation',
  },
  tab: {
    href: '#',
    role: 'presentation',
    tabIndex: 0,
  },
};
```

Modify the second row to use the `Tab` component.

```html path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
<div className="bx--row landing-page__r2">
  <div className="bx--col bx--no-gutter">
    <Tabs {...props.tabs}>
      <Tab {...props.tab} label="About">
        <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--no-gutter bx--grid--full-width">
          <div className="bx--row landing-page__tab-content">
            <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-7">7/16</div>
            <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--offset-lg-1 bx--col-lg-8">
              8/16
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </Tab>
      <Tab {...props.tab} label="Design">
        <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--no-gutter bx--grid--full-width">
          <div className="bx--row landing-page__tab-content">
            <div className="bx--col-lg-16">
              Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Carbon kit
              contains all resources you need to get started.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </Tab>
      <Tab {...props.tab} label="Develop">
        <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--no-gutter bx--grid--full-width">
          <div className="bx--row landing-page__tab-content">
            <div className="bx--col-lg-16">
              Carbon provides styles and components in Vanilla, React, Angular,
              and Vue for anyone building on the web.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</div>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We're using the grid for the page layout, but we also need to apply
the grid within the tab content. When doing so, make sure the nested grid has
the expected `grid` > `row` > `col` DOM structure.

</InlineNotification>

Hold up! If you were to run
[DAP](https://www.ibm.com/able/dynamic-assessment-plug-in.html) to check for
accessibility violations, you'd see
`Multiple navigation landmarks must have unique labels specified with aria-label or aria-labelledby`
because both the `Breadcrumb` and `Tabs` components use `<nav>` elements. To
fix, add `aria-label` to the `Breadcrumb` opening tag:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash aria-label="Page navigation">
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Same goes for the `Tabs` opening tag:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<Tabs {...props.tabs} aria-label="Tab navigation">
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Next, we'll need to add a styling override to move the tabs to the right on
large viewports. Create a file `_overrides.scss` in `src/content/LandingPage`
with this declaration block.

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_overrides.scss
.landing-page__r2 .bx--tabs__nav {
  right: 0;
}
```

Then in `_landing-page.scss` add this import at the top of the file.

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
@import './overrides.scss';
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We don't have to include this in a separate file, but it's nice to
keep overrides separate from your application's styling so when migrating to
future Carbon versions and if there are breaking changes via different class
names, you have a consolidated list of styling declaration blocks to review.

</InlineNotification>

We can now add our images and text for each column in the first `Tab` in
`LandingPage.js`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
<Tab {...props.tab} label="About">
  <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--no-gutter bx--grid--full-width">
    <div className="bx--row landing-page__tab-content">
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-7">
        <h2 className="landing-page__subheading">
          What is Carbon?
        </h2>
        <p className="landing-page__p">
          Carbon is IBM’s open-source design system for digital
          products and experiences. With the IBM Design Language
          as its foundation, the system consists of working code,
          design tools and resources, human interface guidelines,
          and a vibrant community of contributors.
        </p>
        <Button>Learn more</Button>
      </div>
      <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--offset-lg-1 bx--col-lg-8">
        <img
          className="landing-page__illo"
          src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tab-illo.png`}
          alt="Carbon illustration"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Tab>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now let's set the image size in `_landing-page.scss`:

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__illo {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

Assuming that the second and third tab would have a similar design, we would set
them up in the same way. However, since our design specs don't show those tabs,
we'll leave the code as is.

### Third row

The third row will be created in a later tutorial, so we'll just add the headers
for now.

```html path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js
<div className="bx--row landing-page__r3">
  <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">
    <h3 className="landing-page__label">The Principles</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">Carbon is Open</div>
  <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">Carbon is Modular</div>
  <div className="bx--col-md-4 bx--col-lg-4">Carbon is Consistent</div>
</div>
```

## Style landing page

We've added basic layout styles in `_landing-page.scss`, so now let's add type,
color, and spacing styles to match the design. We'll be using our
[spacing tokens](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview).
In `app.scss`, add these imports at the **top** of the file so we can use Carbon
breakpoints, tokens, and typography Sass mixins and functions:

```scss path=src/app.scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vendor/@carbon/type/scss/font-family.scss';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vendor/@carbon/layout/scss/breakpoint.scss';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography.scss';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vars.scss';
```

### Banner

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Banner vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-spacing.png)

<Caption>Banner vertical spacing</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<InlineNotification>

**Pro tip:** `CTRL-G` toggles the grid in Sketch.

</InlineNotification>

Back to `_landing-page.scss`, we need to add space above the breadcrumb and
below the heading. For that, add:

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__banner {
  padding-top: $spacing-05;
  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;
}
```

Referencing the
[spacing token table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview#spacing-scale),
`16px` can be set with the `$spacing-05` token. The design calls for `128px` of
space below the heading and that's not in the spacing scale. We can achieve this
in Sass by multiplying 32px (`$spacing-07`) by 4. We could use `128px` or `8rem`
directly in our styling, but using our tokens preserves consistency should the
token values get updated in the future.

Looking at the design, we need a wall-to-wall light gray background behind the
banner and also behind the third row. This is a great opportunity to use a Sass
mixin. We could put this at the top of `_landing-page.scss`, but it's best
practice to place mixins in a dedicated file, so create a `_mixins.scss` file in
`src/content/LandingPage`.

Add the following in `_mixins.scss`. Per the design we need to use Gray 10 for
our banner background color, which can be set with the `$ui-01`
[color token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage). Also,
we want the background to extend into the grid's outermost gutters to go the
full width of the viewport, so given the DOM structure, we can achieve that by
setting the background in an absolutely positioned pseudo element.

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_mixins.scss
@mixin landing-page-background() {
  background-color: $ui-01;
  position: relative;

  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: -$spacing-05;
    top: 0;
    right: -$spacing-05;
    bottom: 0;
    background: $ui-01;
    z-index: -1;
  }
}
```

After you have created `_mixins.scss`, import it at the **top** of
`_landing-page.scss`. By now you should have two imports:

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
@import './mixins.scss';
@import './overrides.scss';
```

Now to use the new mixin, update the `.landing-page__banner` declaration block
to:

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__banner {
  padding-top: $spacing-05;
  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;
  @include landing-page-background;
}
```

Next, we can see that the `h1` is using the `heading-05` type token.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Banner heading type](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-type.png)

<Caption>Banner heading type</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

The Sketch symbol naming is consistent with the development Sass tokens to help
translate design to development. So, looking up the
[type token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/productive),
we know to use `productive-heading-05`:

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__heading {
  @include carbon--type-style('productive-heading-05');
}
```

### Row two

For our second row, we need to fix the tabs vertical positioning to match the
design. By inspecting the tabs component, you can see that the tab height
computes to `40px`. We can use that to create our negative top margin in rem
units.

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__r2 {
  margin-top: rem(-40px);
}
```

We also need to adjust our vertical spacing and type treatment. Like before,
it's a matter of using spacing and type tokens like so:

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Row 2 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r2-spacing.png)

<Caption>Row 2 vertical spacing</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You may be wondering why there are vertical gaps between the type and
spacers. Each type token has a line height that's suited for its font size. The
vertical spacers adjacently touch the line height boundaries and not the
baseline, for consistency as well as development ease so `margins` and
`paddings` don't need to offset line heights.

</InlineNotification>

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__tab-content {
  padding-top: $layout-05;
  padding-bottom: $layout-05;
}

.landing-page__subheading {
  @include carbon--type-style('productive-heading-03');
  @include carbon--font-weight('semibold');
}

.landing-page__p {
  @include carbon--type-style('productive-heading-03');
  margin-top: $spacing-06;
  margin-bottom: $spacing-08;

  @include carbon--breakpoint-between((320px + 1), md) {
    max-width: 75%;
  }
}
```

### Row three

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Row 3 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r3-spacing.png)

<Caption>Row 3 vertical spacing</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Let's also add some styles for the last row, even though that will get used
later in the tutorial. You'll notice that we get to re-use the
`landing-page-background` mixin that we just created.

```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss
.landing-page__r3 {
  padding-top: $spacing-09;
  padding-bottom: $spacing-09;
  @include landing-page-background;
}

.landing-page__label {
  @include carbon--type-style('heading-01');
}
```

Ta-da! You should see a finished landing page! Now we can move on to the repo
page.

## Add repo page grid

Now in our `RepoPage.js` we'll add our grid containers in the `return` section.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
return (
  <div className="bx--grid bx--grid--full-width bx--grid--no-gutter repo-page">
    <div className="bx--row repo-page__r1">
      <div className="bx--col-lg-16">Data table will go here</div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Build repo page

We currently have `RepoPage.js` that just contains a grid and placeholder
content for the time being. In the next tutorial step we're going to be querying
an API to populate the `DataTable` component in this page. As a best practice to
separate data fetching from the presentation components, go ahead and create a
`RepoTable.js` as a sibling to `RepoPage.js` in `src/content/RepoPage`.

### Build data table

First, we'll add our data table by importing a few components in `RepoTable.js`:

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js
import React from 'react';
import {
  DataTable,
  TableContainer,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableExpandHeader,
  TableHeader,
  TableBody,
  TableExpandRow,
  TableCell,
  TableExpandedRow,
} from 'carbon-components-react';
```

Then, let's create the `RepoTable` component and export it at the very bottom of
`RepoTable.js`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js
const RepoTable = ({ rows, headers }) => {
  return (
    <DataTable
      rows={rows}
      headers={headers}
      render={({
        rows,
        headers,
        getHeaderProps,
        getRowProps,
        getTableProps,
      }) => (
        <TableContainer
          title="Carbon Repositories"
          description="A collection of public Carbon repositories.">
          <Table {...getTableProps()}>
            <TableHead>
              <TableRow>
                <TableExpandHeader />
                {headers.map(header => (
                  <TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header })}>
                    {header.header}
                  </TableHeader>
                ))}
              </TableRow>
            </TableHead>
            <TableBody>
              {rows.map(row => (
                <React.Fragment key={row.id}>
                  <TableExpandRow {...getRowProps({ row })}>
                    {row.cells.map(cell => (
                      <TableCell key={cell.id}>{cell.value}</TableCell>
                    ))}
                  </TableExpandRow>
                  <TableExpandedRow colSpan={headers.length + 1}>
                    <p>Row description</p>
                  </TableExpandedRow>
                </React.Fragment>
              ))}
            </TableBody>
          </Table>
        </TableContainer>
      )}
    />
  );
};

export default RepoTable;

This component uses two props, `rows` and `headers`, and returns a Carbon
`DataTable`. As for where the various `Table*` components came from? The
[DataTable story](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=DataTable&selectedStory=with%20expansion)
in Storybook was used to put together the data table structure.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `getTableProps`, `getHeaderProps`, and `getRowProps` functions
each tell the `DataTable` component to process and return the necessary props
that are needed by the `Table`, `Header` and `Row` components respectively. We
take the return of that function (an object containing the props) and
[spread it out](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes)
into the component.

At this point, return to `RepoPage.js` because now we need to render a static
`RepoTable`.

### Render data table

Import `RepoTable` in `RepoPage.js`.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import RepoTable from './RepoTable';
```

Then below the imports, include the following arrays to pass into the
`RepoTable` component. We'll be setting the `rows` array from an API in the next
tutorial step, but for now, static example rows will suffice.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
const headers = [
  {
    key: 'name',
    header: 'Name',
  },
  {
    key: 'createdAt',
    header: 'Created',
  },
  {
    key: 'updatedAt',
    header: 'Updated',
  },
  {
    key: 'issueCount',
    header: 'Open Issues',
  },
  {
    key: 'stars',
    header: 'Stars',
  },
  {
    key: 'links',
    header: 'Links',
  },
];

const rows = [
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Repo 1',
    createdAt: 'Date',
    updatedAt: 'Date',
    issueCount: '123',
    stars: '456',
    links: 'Links',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    name: 'Repo 2',
    createdAt: 'Date',
    updatedAt: 'Date',
    issueCount: '123',
    stars: '456',
    links: 'Links',
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    name: 'Repo 3',
    createdAt: 'Date',
    updatedAt: 'Date',
    issueCount: '123',
    stars: '456',
    links: 'Links',
  },
];
```

Lastly in `RepoPage.js`, we need to simply replace `Data table will go here`
with:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Style repo page

Our styles for the repo page are mostly fine. We just need to update a few
vertical spacing issues.

In `_repo-page.scss`, add the following styles:

```scss path=src/content/RepoPage/_repo-page.scss
.repo-page .bx--row {
  padding-top: $spacing-05;
  padding-bottom: $spacing-05;
}
```

Congratulations! We've now created our static repo page!
