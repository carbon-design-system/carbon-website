### Preview

The [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) is very well
documented, and even though the focus of this tutorial isn't learning and using
GraphQL, it's a great opportunity to fetch Carbon-related data for this Carbon
tutorial.

To do so, we'll be using Apollo Client, the front-end component of the
[Apollo Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/intro/platform). Apollo
provides several open source tools for using GraphQL throughout your
application’s stack. Apollo Client is a sophisticated GraphQL client that
manages data and state in an application.

A [preview](https://react-step-4--carbon-tutorial.netlify.com) of what you will
build (see repositories page):

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) that
we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and cloned
that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and do so
by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b react-step-3 upstream/react-step-3
```

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-2) left off. Stop your app with
`CTRL-C` and let's get everything installed.

## Install dependencies

We'll need to install three new dependencies to incorporate Apollo into our
application.

- `apollo-boost` - package containing everything you need to set up Apollo
  Client
- `graphql` - parses your GraphQL queries
- `react-apollo` - Apollo integration for React

Install them with the command:

```bash
yarn add apollo-boost@0.4.2 graphql@14.3.1 react-apollo@2.5.6
```

## Create access token

You'll need a personal access token from your GitHub account in order to make
requests to the GitHub API. Check out
[this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
to see how to get one.

When you get to the scope/permissions step, you can leave them all unchecked. We
don't need any special permissions, we just need access to the public API.

Once you have your token, we need to put it in a place where create-react-app
can use it. When your application is being built and developed, create-react-app
will parse environmental variables in any file that starts with `.env` and make
them available under `process.env.MY_VARIABLE`.

One caveat is that we need to start our variables with `REACT_APP_`. You can
read more about environmental variables in
[create-react-app's guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

Since we don't want to commit this file to Git, we can put it in `.env.local`
which is in our `.gitignore` list. Your file should just have a single line like
this one, where the `x`s are replaced with your unique token.

```bash path=.env.local
REACT_APP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxx
```

Go ahead and start your app with `yarn start`, or, if your app is running,
you'll need to restart it to get access to this token.

## Connect to Apollo

The `react-apollo` library gives us a component that we need to put at the base
of our application. Typically the best place for things that need to wrap the
entire application is at the root of the application. For us, that's at
`src/index.js`.

Add these two imports to `src/index.js`:

```javascript path=src/index.js
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost';
import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';
```

Next, make your client by providing a URI for the GitHub GraphQL API as well as
an authorization header using the environmental variable you just added to
`.env.local`.

```javascript path=src/index.js
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.github.com/graphql',
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.REACT_APP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
  },
});
```

Now we can wrap our application with `ApolloProvider`. At the same time, we'll
pass in the client we just made as a prop to the `ApolloProvider` component.
Replace:

```html path=src/index.js
<Router>
  <App />
</Router>
```

With:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/index.js
<ApolloProvider client={client}>
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>
</ApolloProvider>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Fetch data

### Imports

Add the following imports at the top of `RepoPage.js`:

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import { gql } from 'apollo-boost';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';
```

### Query

Next we'll assemble our GraphQL query to fetch only the data we need from the
GraphQL API. We'll do this using the `gql` helper we just imported. The `gql`
helper lets you write GraphQL queries using interpolated strings (backticks) in
JavaScript. In addition, we'll be using the `Query` component from
`react-apollo` which gives us some great information about our query's loading
state in addition to the data.

You can use GitHub's [explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) tool
to write and test your own queries. Try copying the query below and experiment
with changing the properties. You can also click the "Docs" button in the top
right of the explorer to view all of the available data and query parameters.

If you'd like some more information regarding writing queries and using the
Query component, we recommend
[Apollo's documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries) on
this topic.

Add this after your imports:

```graphql path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
const REPO_QUERY = gql`
  query REPO_QUERY {
    # Let's use carbon as our organization
    organization(login: "carbon-design-system") {
      # We'll grab all the repositories in one go. To load more resources
      # continuously, see the advanced topics.
      repositories(first: 75, orderBy: { field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC }) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          url
          homepageUrl
          issues(filterBy: { states: OPEN }) {
            totalCount
          }
          stargazers {
            totalCount
          }
          releases(first: 1) {
            totalCount
            nodes {
              name
            }
          }
          name
          updatedAt
          createdAt
          description
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Helpers

Below that, we should have our table headers set in a previous step that are
good to go. Let's also keep our example rows below that.

Our last column in the data table will be a comma-separated list of repository
and home page links, so let's create a component called `LinkList`.

Import `Link` at the top of `RepoPage.js`.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import { Link } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

Then use `Link` in this component that has two props (`url` and `homepageUrl`)
and returns an unordered list. If the repository does not have a home page URL,
only render the repository link.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
const LinkList = ({ url, homepageUrl }) => (
  <ul style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <li>
      <Link href={url}>GitHub</Link>
    </li>
    {homepageUrl && (
      <li>
        <span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span>
        <Link href={homepageUrl}>Homepage</Link>
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>
);
```

As a final helper, let's create a function that transforms row data to our
expected header keys. Notice how we're using our new `LinkList` component to
generate the value of the `links` key in each row.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
const getRowItems = (rows) =>
  rows.map((row) => ({
    ...row,
    key: row.id,
    stars: row.stargazers.totalCount,
    issueCount: row.issues.totalCount,
    createdAt: new Date(row.createdAt).toLocaleDateString(),
    updatedAt: new Date(row.updatedAt).toLocaleDateString(),
    links: <LinkList url={row.url} homepageUrl={row.homepageUrl} />,
  }));
```

### Query component

At this point, we should run our query and `console.log()` the results to verify
that the request is working.

The `Query` component from `react-apollo` lets us render different content based
on the state of our request. When `loading` is true, we'll render `Loading...`
for the time being. If there's an issue, we'll render the corresponding error
message.

Finally, if neither of those are true, it means we have our data! One nice
advantage of GraphQL is that as long as there are no errors, we can be certain
the properties on the data we requested aren't `undefined`.

We need to render the `RepoTable` in `Query`'s `return()` statement once the
request is no longer loading and when there are no errors. To do so, replace the
`RepoTable` line with the following `Query`.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />
```

Notice how we're passing the `REPO_QUERY` that we previously defined into the
`query` prop.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
<Query query={REPO_QUERY}>
  {({ loading, error, data }) => {
    // Wait for the request to complete
    if (loading) return 'Loading...';

    // Something went wrong with the data fetching
    if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

    // If we're here, we've got our data!
    console.log(data.organization);

    return (
      <>
        <RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Query>
```

The page will look the same as we're still rendering our static example rows,
but if you view your browser's console (e.g.
[Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)),
you should see the response from GitHub!

## Populate data table

Now that we have that data, let's populate the data table. Replace
`console.log(data.organization);` with the following that destructures the
`data.organization` object. Once we have the repositories, we can call our
`getRowItems()` helper to build the data table rows.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
// If we're here, we've got our data!
const { repositories } = data.organization;
const rows = getRowItems(repositories.nodes);
```

Then, towards the top of `RepoPage.js` delete the `rows` array because we no
longer need the example rows.

### Render repository descriptions

The data table component and its pieces use a common React pattern called
[render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). This a really
powerful way for libraries to give developers control of rendering and
manipulating their data.

Revisiting `RepoTable.js`, we are already passing in our row objects along with
headers for each column. The `render` prop is being used to tell the data table
how to render the headers and rows. That prop takes a function that receives the
processed headers and rows as arguments as well as some helper functions for
rendering the table.

One common hurdle with the data table is how to access data that might not
correspond with a table column but is needed to compute the value of a cell that
does. The data table component processes and controls only the row properties
which corresponds to headers (columns). Because of this, the `rows` object you
get access to in the render prop function is _different_ than the one you passed
in to the `rows` prop.

We need to modify one aspect of the data table because if you expand a row, it
says `Row description`. We want to update that with the repository description
coming from the GitHub API. This is an example of where we need a simple look-up
function to find the data we care about - data that does not directly correspond
to a column.

To do so, in `RepoTable.js`, add this look-up function as the first lines inside
the `RepoTable`. This should go immediately before the component's `return()`.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js
const getRowDescription = (rowId) => {
  const row = rows.find(({ id }) => id === rowId);
  return row ? row.description : '';
};
```

Finally, in `RepoTable.js`, replace `<p>Row description</p>` with:

```html path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js
<p>{getRowDescription(row.id)}</p>
```

## Add loading

At this point, the first time that you visit the repositories page, we're
querying the GitHub API and rendering the response through the `DataTable`
component. We could stop here, but there's more to be done! Let's replace the
`Loading...` string with the
[DataTableSkeleton component](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=DataTableSkeleton).

To do so, back to `RepoPage.js`, add the `DataTableSkeleton` import by modifying
the existing `carbon-components-react` import.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import { Link, DataTableSkeleton } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

Then replace the `if (loading) return 'Loading...';` with:

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
if (loading)
  return (
    <DataTableSkeleton
      columnCount={headers.length + 1}
      rowCount={10}
      headers={headers}
    />
  );
```

We need to tell the loading skeleton how many rows to render, so let's use 10
skeleton rows to prepare for the next enhancement...

## Add pagination

Pagination! Instead of rendering every repository, let's add pagination to the
data table to only render 10 at a time. Depending on your specific requirements,
you may need to fetch new data each time that you interact with the pagination
component, but for simplicity, we're going to make one request to fetch all
data, and then paginate the in-memory row data.

We'll be using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to
manage our state. Hooks are a relatively new React API that allows us to author
a React component's stateful logic in a function component rather than a class
component. Using hooks means we don't need to worry about complex lifecycle
methods.

Import React's [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) by
modifying the `React` import.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

Then initialize the new state variables that we'll use for pagination as the
first lines inside the `RepoPage` component, above the outer `return()`.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
const RepoPage = () => {
  const [totalItems, setTotalItems] = useState(0);
  const [firstRowIndex, setFirstRowIndex] = useState(0);
  const [currentPageSize, setCurrentPageSize] = useState(10);
...
```

This initializes the total number of rows and the index of the first row to `0`,
and the page size to `10` as we also specified in our loading skeleton.

Next we need to use the function that updates the `totalItems` state,
`setTotalItems()`, after we destructure our `data.organization.repositories`.
Your block that transforms row data should look like:

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
// If we're here, we've got our data!
const { repositories } = data.organization;
setTotalItems(repositories.totalCount);
const rows = getRowItems(repositories.nodes);
```

Then we need to update our `RepoTable` `rows` prop to only render the subset of
rows for the current "page". Update
`<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />` to:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
<RepoTable
  headers={headers}
  rows={rows.slice(
    firstRowIndex,
    firstRowIndex + currentPageSize
  )}
/>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We only pass the rows that we want our table to display. We can do
this by slicing the our array of rows depending on the first item and the page
size.

</InlineNotification>

Finally, let's add the `Pagination` to update our state variables and cause the
data table to render new rows.

Import `Pagination` by updating the `carbon-components-react` import.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
import { Link, DataTableSkeleton, Pagination } from 'carbon-components-react';
```

Immediately after the `RepoTable` closing tag (`/>`), add the `Pagination`
component using the state variables that we previously initialized.

```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js
<Pagination
  totalItems={totalItems}
  backwardText="Previous page"
  forwardText="Next page"
  pageSize={currentPageSize}
  pageSizes={[5, 10, 15, 25]}
  itemsPerPageText="Items per page"
  onChange={({ page, pageSize }) => {
    if (pageSize !== currentPageSize) {
      setCurrentPageSize(pageSize);
    }
    setFirstRowIndex(pageSize * (page - 1));
  }}
/>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `Pagination` component isn't inherently connected in any way to
the `DataTable` - we need to tell it what to do when a change occurs using the
`onChange` prop. This includes both page size changes and displaying different
rows.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Like the other Carbon React components, `Pagination` component
examples can be found in
[Storybook](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=Pagination) by
browsing the story and knobs.

</InlineNotification>

That does it! Your data table should fetch GitHub data on first render. You can
expand each row to see the repository's description. You can modify the
pagination items per page and cycle through pages or jump to a specific page of
repositories.
