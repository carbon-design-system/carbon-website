This step takes our static components and populates them with data from the
GitHub GraphQL API â€“ loading states and all. We'll be displaying Carbon
repository information in a data table.

### Preview

The [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28) is
very well documented, we'll use it to fetch Carbon-related data for this Carbon
tutorial.

To do so, we'll be using
[Octokit Core](https://github.com/octokit/core.js/#readme), a client that makes
it easy to interact with GitHub's APIs.

A
[preview](https://carbon-tutorial-nextjs-8xoxdcixk-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/)
of what you will build (see repositories page):

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-nextjs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b v11-next-step-3 upstream/v11-next-step-3
```

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies and build the app:

```bash
yarn && yarn build
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-2) left off. Stop your app with
`CTRL-C` and let's get everything installed.

## Install dependencies

We'll need to install `@octokit/core`, a package that allows us to query GitHub
APIs easily. Stop your development server with `CTRL-C` and install the octokit
dependency with:

```bash
yarn add @octokit/core@4.2.0
```

Then, start the app again. If your app's currently running, you'll need to
restart it.

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Fetch data

### Imports

We'll be using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to call
a function to fetch our data when the component renders.

Import React's [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) by
modifying the `React` import in `src/app/repos/page.js`.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
```

Add the following import below the react import in `RepoPage`:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import { Octokit } from '@octokit/core';
```

### Initializing Octokit client

Directly below all your imports, initialize an octokit client which we'll use to
query our `RepoTable` data:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
const octokitClient = new Octokit({});
```

### API Request

Next, we'll assemble our GitHub API request to fetch a list of repositories that
belong to the `carbon-design-system` GitHub organization. We'll do this by using
a `useEffect` hook that will use octokit to query GitHub's API
[repositories endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-repositories).

Let's declare a `useEffect` hook immediately below the component definition and
above the return. We'll use this to query GitHub's API when the component first
renders:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
function RepoPage() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getCarbonRepos() {
      const res = await octokitClient.request('GET /orgs/{org}/repos', {
        org: 'carbon-design-system',
        per_page: 75,
        sort: 'updated',
        direction: 'desc',
      });

      if (res.status === 200) {
        console.log(res.data);
      } else {
        console.log('Error obtaining repository data');
      }
    }

    getCarbonRepos();
  }, []);
```

At this point, if you navigate to the Repositories page `/repos` in your running
app and view your browser's console (e.g.
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)), you should see
the response from GitHub!

### Helpers

Our last column in the data table will be a comma-separated list of repository
and home page links, so let's create a component called `LinkList`.

Import `Link` at the top of `/app/repos/page.js`. The imports should look like
this.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import { Link, Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';
```

Then use `Link` in this component. It has two props (`url` and `homepageUrl`)
and returns an unordered list. If the repository does not have a home page URL,
only render the repository link.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
const LinkList = ({ url, homepageUrl }) => (
  <ul style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <li>
      <Link href={url}>GitHub</Link>
    </li>
    {homepageUrl && (
      <li>
        <span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span>
        <Link href={homepageUrl}>Homepage</Link>
      </li>
    )}
  </ul>
);
```

As a final helper, let's create a function that transforms row data to our
expected header keys. Notice how we're using our new `LinkList` component to
generate the value of the `links` key in each row.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
const getRowItems = (rows) =>
  rows.map((row) => ({
    ...row,
    key: row.id,
    stars: row.stargazers_count,
    issueCount: row.open_issues_count,
    createdAt: new Date(row.created_at).toLocaleDateString(),
    updatedAt: new Date(row.updated_at).toLocaleDateString(),
    links: <LinkList url={row.html_url} homepageUrl={row.homepage} />,
  }));
```

### Populate data table

Now that we have our data, let's dispose of our dummy `rows` and populate the
data table with real data.

First, towards the top of `RepoPage` delete the `rows` array because we no
longer need the example rows.

Next, let's add a couple variables that will help us store useful information
when fetching the data and keep track of the loading state.

We'll be using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) again to
manage our state.

Import React's [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) by
modifying the `React` import.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
```

Then, inside the `RepoPage` component:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
function RepoPage() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState();
  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);
```

Now, instead of using `console.log` to log the github data response, let's treat
the response data by passing it through our `getRowItems` helper and saving the
result in our new `rows` variable. Replace the `console.log(res.data);` line
inside `if (res.status === 200)` with:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
setRows(getRowItems(res.data));
```

Let's also replace our error log line inside the `else` statement with:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
setError('Error obtaining repository data');
```

To complete our `getCarbonRepos` function, let's set the loading state to false
right after the `else` statement:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
if (res.status === 200) {
  setRows(getRowItems(res.data));
} else {
  setError('Error obtaining repository data');
}
setLoading(false);
```

Finally, let's modify our component's `return()` statement to display different
information depending on the states of our request: loading, error or complete.
Replace the current return statement with:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
if (loading) {
  return 'Loading...';
}

if (error) {
  return `Error! ${error}`;
}

// If we're here, we've got our data!
return (
  <Grid className="repo-page">
    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className="repo-page__r1">
      <RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />
    </Column>
  </Grid>
);
```

### Render repository descriptions

The data table component and its pieces use a common React pattern called
[render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). This is a really
powerful way for libraries to give developers control of rendering and
manipulating their data.

Revisiting `RepoTable.js`, we are already passing in our row objects along with
headers for each column. The `render` prop is being used to tell the data table
how to render the headers and rows. That prop takes a function that receives the
processed headers and rows as arguments as well as some helper functions for
rendering the table.

One common hurdle with the data table is how to access data that might not
correspond with a table column but is needed to compute the value of a cell that
does. The data table component processes and controls only the row properties
which corresponds to headers (columns). Because of this, the `rows` object you
get access to in the render prop function is _different_ than the one you passed
in to the `rows` prop.

We need to modify one aspect of the data table because if you expand a row, it
says `Row description`. We want to update that with the repository description
coming from the GitHub API. This is an example of where we need a simple look-up
function to find the data we care about - data that does not directly correspond
to a column.

To do so, in `RepoTable.js`, add this look-up function as the first lines inside
the `RepoTable`. This should go immediately before the component's `return()`.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/RepoTable.js
const getRowDescription = (rowId) => {
  const row = rows.find(({ id }) => id === rowId);
  return row ? row.description : '';
};
```

Finally, in `RepoTable.js`, replace `<p>Row description</p>` with:

```html path=src/app/repos/RepoTable.js
<p>{getRowDescription(row.id)}</p>
```

## Add loading

At this point, the first time that you visit the repositories page, we're
querying the GitHub API and rendering the response through the `DataTable`
component. We could stop here, but there's more to be done! Let's replace the
`Loading...` string with the
[DataTableSkeleton component](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable--skeleton).

To do so, back to `RepoPage`, add the `DataTableSkeleton` import by modifying
the existing `@carbon/react` import.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import { Link, DataTableSkeleton, Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';
```

Then replace the `if (loading) return 'Loading...';` with:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
if (loading) {
  return (
    <Grid className="repo-page">
      <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className="repo-page__r1">
        <DataTableSkeleton
          columnCount={headers.length + 1}
          rowCount={10}
          headers={headers}
        />
      </Column>
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

We need to tell the loading skeleton how many rows to render, so let's use 10
skeleton rows to prepare for the next enhancement...

## Add pagination

Pagination! Instead of rendering every repository, let's add pagination to the
data table to only render 10 at a time. Depending on your specific requirements,
you may need to fetch new data each time that you interact with the pagination
component, but for simplicity, we're going to make one request to fetch all
data, and then paginate the in-memory row data.

Initialize the new state variables that we'll use for pagination as the first
lines inside the `RepoPage`.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
function RepoPage() {
  const [firstRowIndex, setFirstRowIndex] = useState(0);
  const [currentPageSize, setCurrentPageSize] = useState(10);
...
```

This initializes the total number of rows and the index of the first row to `0`,
and the page size to `10` as we also specified in our loading skeleton.

Then we need to update our `RepoTable` `rows` prop to only render the subset of
rows for the current "page". Update
`<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />` to:

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
<RepoTable
  headers={headers}
  rows={rows.slice(firstRowIndex, firstRowIndex + currentPageSize)}
/>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We only pass the rows that we want our table to display. We can do
this by slicing the array of rows depending on the first item and the page size.

</InlineNotification>

Finally, let's add the `Pagination` to update our state variables and cause the
data table to render new rows.

Import `Pagination` by updating the `@carbon/react` import.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
import {
  Link,
  DataTableSkeleton,
  Pagination,
  Grid,
  Column,
} from '@carbon/react';
```

Immediately after the `RepoTable` closing tag (`/>`), add the `Pagination`
component using the state variables that we previously initialized.

```javascript path=src/app/repos/page.js
<Pagination
  totalItems={rows.length}
  backwardText="Previous page"
  forwardText="Next page"
  pageSize={currentPageSize}
  pageSizes={[5, 10, 15, 25]}
  itemsPerPageText="Items per page"
  onChange={({ page, pageSize }) => {
    if (pageSize !== currentPageSize) {
      setCurrentPageSize(pageSize);
    }
    setFirstRowIndex(pageSize * (page - 1));
  }}
/>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `Pagination` component isn't inherently connected in any way to
the `DataTable` - we need to tell it what to do when a change occurs using the
`onChange` prop. This includes both page size changes and displaying different
rows.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Like the other Carbon React components, `Pagination` component
examples can be found in
[Storybook](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-pagination--pagination)
by browsing the story and knobs.

</InlineNotification>

That does it! Your data table should fetch GitHub data on first render. You can
expand each row to see the repository's description. You can modify the
pagination items per page and cycle through pages or jump to a specific page of
repositories.
