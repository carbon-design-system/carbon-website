<PageDescription>

With two pages comprised entirely of Carbon components, let's revisit the
landing page and build a couple components of our own by using Carbon pictograms
and tokens.

## Preview

Carbon provides a solid foundation for building web applications through its
color palette, layout, spacing, type, as well as common building blocks in the
form of components. So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two
pages.

Next, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.
We'll do so by including accessibility and responsive considerations all
throughout.

A
[preview](https://carbon-tutorial-nextjs-git-v11-next-step-5-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/)
of what you'll build (see bottom of page):

  allowfullscreen="true"

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-nextjs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b v11-next-step-4 upstream/v11-next-step-4
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

</InlineNotification>

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current
directory and not continuing from the previous step):

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-3) left off.

## Review design

Here's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and
three subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll
assume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning
it's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,
we'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.

![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)

<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>

## Create components

First we need files for the components, so create an `Info` folder in
`src/components`. Even though we're building multiple components, their names
all start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in
components. Create these files:

### Add files

```bash
src/components/Info
├──_info.scss
└──Info.js
```

Import `_info.scss` in `app.scss` after all of the `tutorial-header.scss`
import.

```scss path=src/app/globals.scss
@use '@/components/Info/info';
```

### InfoSection component

Let's create the parent component that includes the "The Principles" heading.
That markup currently looks like this in `LandingPage`:

```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js
<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className="landing-page__r3">
  <Grid>
    <Column lg={4} md={2} sm={4}>
      <h3 className="landing-page__label">The Principles</h3>
    </Column>
    <Column
      lg={{ start: 5, span: 3 }}
      md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
      sm={4}
      className="landing-page__title">
      Carbon is Open
    </Column>
    <Column
      lg={{ start: 9, span: 3 }}
      md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
      sm={4}
      className="landing-page__title">
      Carbon is Modular
    </Column>
    <Column
      lg={{ start: 13, span: 3 }}
      md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
      sm={4}
      className="landing-page__title">
      Carbon is Consistent
    </Column>
  </Grid>
</Column>
```

We want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. First, we only
want this component's class names; we don't want to include `landing-page__r3`
as that's specific to the landing page. For that we'll use React `props` so we
can pass in and use `props.className`.

We'll also:

- Add component class names like `info-section`, `info-card`, and
  `info-section__heading`
- We will be using the `Grid` and `Column` components
- Replace `The Principles` with `{props.heading}`
- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `{props.children}`

Using `props` we can render any heading and any number of children components
(`InfoCard` that we'll build soon.)

```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js
import { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';

const InfoSection = (props) => (
  <Grid className={`${props.className} info-section`}>
    <Column md={8} lg={16} xlg={3}>
      <h3 className="info-section__heading">{props.heading}</h3>
    </Column>
    {props.children}
  </Grid>
);
```

At this point let's import our needed styles and add styling for the new class
names that we just added.

```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;

.info-section__heading {
  @include type-style('heading-01');
  padding-bottom: $spacing-08;
}
```

### InfoCard component

Next up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently
looks like `<Column md={4} lg={4}>Carbon is Open</Column>`. At the bottom of
`Info.js`, add:

```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js
const InfoCard = (props) => {
  return (
    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={5} xlg={4} className="info-card">
      <div>
        <h4 className="info-card__heading">
          {`${splitHeading[0]} `}
          <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>
        </h4>
        <p className="info-card__body">{props.body}</p>
      </div>
      {props.icon()}
    </Column>
  );
};

export { InfoSection, InfoCard };
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Make sure to export the two components!

</InlineNotification>

In doing so, we:

- Added `info-card` classes
- Used `props` to render the heading, body copy, and icon
- Set columns to match the grid

## Use components

Nothing is styled yet, but with our components built let's put them to use. In
`LandingPage`, import the components towards the top of the file.

```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js
import { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '@/components/Info/Info';
```

Next, we will install the pictograms we will use in the header.

```bash
yarn add @carbon/pictograms-react
```

While we're at the top of `LandingPage`, import the pictograms that we'll need
as well.

```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js
import {
  Advocate,
  Globe,
  AcceleratingTransformation,
} from '@carbon/pictograms-react';
```

With everything imported, replace the current:

```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js
<Grid>
  <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className="landing-page__r3">
    <Grid>
      <Column lg={4} md={2} sm={4}>
        <h3 className="landing-page__label">The Principles</h3>
      </Column>
      <Column
        lg={{ start: 5, span: 3 }}
        md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
        sm={4}
        className="landing-page__title">
        Carbon is Open
      </Column>
      <Column
        lg={{ start: 9, span: 3 }}
        md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
        sm={4}
        className="landing-page__title">
        Carbon is Modular
      </Column>
      <Column
        lg={{ start: 13, span: 3 }}
        md={{ start: 3, span: 6 }}
        sm={4}
        className="landing-page__title">
        Carbon is Consistent
      </Column>
    </Grid>
  </Column>
</Grid>
```

With the new components:

```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js
<InfoSection heading="The Principles">
  <InfoCard
    heading="Carbon is Open"
    body="It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute."
    icon={() => <Advocate size={32} />}
  />
  <InfoCard
    heading="Carbon is Modular"
    body="Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user."
    icon={() => <AcceleratingTransformation size={32} />}
  />
  <InfoCard
    heading="Carbon is Consistent"
    body="Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences."
    icon={() => <Globe size={32} />}
  />
</InfoSection>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to large viewport
widths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further styling.

</InlineNotification>

## Add styling

Here's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need
to set type style and borders.

![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)

### Layout

Starting with layout, import the following carbon styles to
`src/components/Info/_info.scss`. Make sure to import the needed carbon styles.

```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;
```

We will then add the following styles to the same file to style our info cards.

```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss
.info-card {
  margin-top: $spacing-09;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding-left: 1rem;

  svg {
    margin-top: $spacing-09;
  }

  @include breakpoint(sm) {
    padding-left: 0;
  }

  div {
    flex-grow: 1; // fill space so icons are bottom aligned
  }

  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides
  @include breakpoint-down(lg) {
    padding-left: 0;
    margin-top: 0;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;

    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {
      padding-top: $spacing-10;
    }

    svg {
      margin-top: -0.25rem;
      margin-right: 2rem;
      min-width: 48px;
      min-height: 48px;
    }
  }

  @include breakpoint(lg) {
    margin-top: 0;
    padding-left: 0;

    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {
      border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;
      padding-left: 1rem;
    }

    svg {
      margin-top: $spacing-12;
    }
  }

  // left border in all items
  @include breakpoint(xlg) {
    margin-top: 0;
    border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;
    padding-left: 1rem;

    svg {
      margin-top: $spacing-12;
    }
  }
}
```

Once you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at
the different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.
There are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.

### Type

Our `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font
sizes according to the design spec. Lets update the heading with the following
type style:

```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss
.info-card__heading {
  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');
}
```

Also, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish
that, add this helper function after the import in `Info.js`.

```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js
// Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array
function createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {
  const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');
  const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();
  return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];
}
```

Then, update `InfoCard` to use `createArrayFromPhrase`.

```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js
const InfoCard = (props) => {
  const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);

  return (
    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className="info-card">
      <h4 className="info-card__heading">
        {`${splitHeading[0]} `}
        <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>
      </h4>
      <p className="info-card__body">{props.body}</p>
      {props.icon()}
    </Column>
  );
};
```

Finally, add the declaration block in `_info.scss` to set `InfoCard` body copy
styles and to bottom-align the pictograms.

```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss
.info-card__body {
  margin-top: $spacing-06;
  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so pictograms are bottom aligned
  @include type-style('body-long-01');

  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports
  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {
    max-width: 75%;
  }
}
```

## Check accessibility

We've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check
[Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) and make sure
our rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.

With the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and
run Accessibility Assessment.
