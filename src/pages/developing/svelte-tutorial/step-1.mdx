Starting with SvelteKit, let's install Carbon and begin using Carbon components.
By the end you will have a Svelte app that uses the UI Shell to navigate between
pages.

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step.

### Fork

To begin, fork
[carbon-tutorial-svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte)
using your GitHub account.

### Clone

Go to your forked repository, copy the SSH or HTTPS URL and in your terminal run
the two commands to get the repository in your local file system and enter that
directory.

```bash
git clone [your fork SSH/HTTPS]
cd carbon-tutorial-svelte
```

### Add upstream remote

Add a remote called `upstream` so we can eventually submit a pull request once
you have completed this tutorial step.

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte.git
```

Or, if you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH with your remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte.git
```

Verify that your forked repository remotes are correct:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Your terminal should output something like this:

```bash
origin	[your forked repo] (fetch)
origin	[your forked repo] (push)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte.git (push)
```

### Branch

Now that we have our repository set up, let's check out the branch for this
tutorial step's starting point. Run the two commands:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b svelte-step-1 upstream/svelte-step-1
```

## Build and start

We have the repository forked to your GitHub account, cloned down to your
machine, and the starting branch checked out. Next, install the Svelte app's
dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your default browser should open up with an empty page that says:
`Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon tutorial.`

## Install Carbon

Even though we installed existing dependencies, we've yet to install the Carbon
packages.

- `carbon-components-svelte` - Svelte components
- `carbon-preprocess-svelte` - Carbon Svelte preprocessors

Stop your development server with `CTRL-C` and install Carbon dependencies with:

```bash
yarn add -D carbon-components-svelte carbon-preprocess-svelte
```

## Configure svelte.config.js

SvelteKit uses [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as a development server.
We need to configure vite to optimize dependencies from
`carbon-components-svelte` that do not support ES Modules (ESM).

In addition, we will utilize the recommended Carbon preprocessor preset. The
preset includes two preprocessors:

- **optimizeImports**: rewrites Carbon Svelte imports to their source path in
  the script block
- **elements**: computes Carbon theme tokens in the style block

```js path=./svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
import * as carbon from 'carbon-preprocess-svelte';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
  preprocess: carbon.presetCarbon(),
  kit: {
    target: '#svelte',
    adapter: adapter(),
    vite: {
      optimizeDeps: { include: ['clipboard-copy'] },
    },
  },
};
```

Then, start the app again.

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app looks as it did before. Next, let's prepare our app for Carbon styles.

In the `src/routes` directory, create a file named `__layout.svelte` (note the
two leading underscores).

```bash
touch src/routes/__layout.svelte
```

### Import styles

In `__layout.svelte`, import the Carbon styles by adding the following at the
top of the file:

```html path=src/routes/__layout.svelte
<script>
  import 'carbon-components-svelte/css/white.css';
</script>
```

This will import the precompiled CSS StyleSheet that contains all styles for the
Carbon Design System white theme. Because it is imported in `__layout.svelte`,
the styles will be applied to all pages of the app.

In a later step, we will optimize the CSS when building the app for production.

We will also need to add a `slot` to the markup in `__layout.svelte`. This will
allow content from other pages to be rendered with this default layout.

```html path=src/routes/__layout.svelte
<script>
  import 'carbon-components-svelte/css/white.css';
</script>

<slot />
```

Next, we'll import a `Button` from Carbon to test that our dependencies are
working properly. At the top of `src/routes/index.svelte`, import the `Button`
by adding the following:

```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<script>
  import { Button } from 'carbon-components-svelte';
</script>
```

In `src/routes/index.svelte`, you can now replace:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<div>
  Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon tutorial.
</div>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

with:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<Button>Button</Button>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Congratulations, you've imported your first component! You should see a Carbon
styled button on the page.

## Add UI Shell

Next, we're going to create a Svelte component called `TutorialHeader` to use
with the UI Shell Carbon component. In the `src` directory, create a `lib`
directory and inside of that, a `TutorialHeader.svelte` file.

```bash
src/lib/
└──TutorialHeader.svelte
```

Next we'll import our Carbon UI Shell components into `TutorialHeader.svelte`.
Set up the file like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/lib/TutorialHeader.svelte
<script>
  import {
    SkipToContent,
    Header,
    HeaderNav,
    HeaderNavItem,
    HeaderUtilities,
    HeaderGlobalAction,
  } from 'carbon-components-svelte';
  import { page } from '$app/stores';
</script>

<header company="IBM" platformName="Carbon Tutorial" href="/">
  <div slot="skip-to-content">
    <SkipToContent />
  </div>
  <HeaderNav>
    <HeaderNavItem
      text="Repositories"
      href="/repos"
      sveltekit:prefetch
      aria-current="{$page.path === '/repos' ? 'page' : undefined}"
    />
  </HeaderNav>
  <HeaderUtilities> </HeaderUtilities>
</header>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** When creating navigation headers, it's important to have a
`Skip to content` link so keyboard users can skip the navigation items and go
straight to the main content.

</InlineNotification>

### Import icons

Now let's import the icons. In the `TutorialHeader.svelte` script block, we need
to import each individual icon we will use.

```javascript path=src/lib/TutorialHeader.svelte
import {
  Notification20,
  UserAvatar20,
  AppSwitcher20,
} from 'carbon-icons-svelte';
```

Then we need to add the `HeaderGlobalAction` component inside of the
`HeaderGlobalBar` where we will add our icons. These represent actions in the
header a user can make. Replace:

```html path=src/lib/TutorialHeader.svelte
<HeaderUtilities> </HeaderUtilities>
```

With:

```html path=src/lib/TutorialHeader.svelte
<HeaderUtilities>
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="Notifications" icon="{Notification20}" />
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="User Avatar" icon="{UserAvatar20}" />
  <HeaderGlobalAction aria-label="App Switcher" icon="{AppSwitcher20}" />
</HeaderUtilities>
```

### Render the header

Next we'll render our UI Shell by importing our `TutorialHeader` component and
`Content` into `__layout.svelte`. We'll also include the `Grid` component as
part of our default layout.

Your imports should look like this:

```html path=src/routes/__layout.svelte
<script>
  import 'carbon-components-svelte/css/white.css';
  import { Content, Grid } from 'carbon-components-svelte';
  import TutorialHeader from '$lib/TutorialHeader.svelte';
</script>
```

Our markup currently just contains a `slot`. Let's update that to include our
imported components. This should look like the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/routes/__layout.svelte
<script>
  import 'carbon-components-svelte/css/white.css';
  import { Content, Grid } from 'carbon-components-svelte';
  import TutorialHeader from '$lib/TutorialHeader.svelte';
</script>

<TutorialHeader />

<Content style="padding: 0">
  <Grid fullWidth>
    <slot />
  </Grid>
</Content>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You should now see a styled UI Shell header and a button below it.

## Create pages

Next thing we need to do is create the files for our content. This files should
be created in the `src/routes` directory.

We already have file `routes/index.svelte` that serves as the landing page.

Create another file called `repos.svelte`. This will map to the `/repos` route
in the app.

```bash
src/routes
├── index.svelte
└── repos.svelte
```

### Content pages

In `index.svelte`, we'll create our component.

```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<div>LANDING PAGE</div>
```

We'll repeat this process with `repos.svelte`.

```html path=src/routes/repos.svelte
<div>REPO PAGE</div>
```

Awesome! We've just created our content pages. SvelteKit has a built-in file
system router; the `routes/index.svelte` will map to `/` and
`routes/repos.svelte` will map to `/repos`.

You should now have a working header that routes to different pages without full
page reload!

## Submit pull request

We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step
and demonstrate a couple of related concepts.

### Continuous integration (CI) check

We have a `ci-check` script defined in `package.json` that verifies file
formatting for files that have been touched since the last Git commit with a
tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io). You'd typically also have that
script run your test suite as part of your CI build. Go ahead and make sure
everything looks good with:

```bash
yarn ci-check
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If the `ci-check` is giving an error, it's likely that some of your
source files are not properly formatted. This could happen if your text editor
isn't formatting with Prettier on save. To get `ci-check` to pass, run
`yarn format` then re-run `yarn ci-check`.

</InlineNotification>

### Git commit and push

Before we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat(tutorial): complete step 1"
```

Then, push to your repository:

```bash
git push origin svelte-step-1
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If your Git remote protocol is HTTPS instead of SSH, you may be
prompted to authenticate with GitHub when you push changes. If your GitHub
account has two-factor authentication enabled, we recommend that you follow
these instructions to
[create a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
That lets you use your token instead of password when performing Git operations
over HTTPS.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If you receive a `non-fast-forward` error, it's likely that your
forked repository is behind the original repository and needs to be updated.
This can happen if the tutorial was updated after you began working on it. To
fix, run `git pull upstream svelte-step-1` to merge the changes into your
branch, then you can try pushing again. Or, you can
[manually merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) in the
upstream changes.

</InlineNotification>

### Pull request (PR)

Finally, visit
[carbon-tutorial-svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte)
to "Compare & pull request". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to
`svelte-step-1` into `base: svelte-step-1`. Take notice of the
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) bot that deploys a preview of your PR every
time that you push new commits. These previews can be shared and viewed by
anybody to assist the PR review process.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but
not merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches
pristine and ready for the next person!
