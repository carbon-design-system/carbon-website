<PageDescription>

With two pages comprised entirely of Carbon components, let's revisit the
landing page and build a couple components of our own by using Carbon icons and
tokens.

## Preview

Carbon provides a solid foundation for building web applications through its
color palette, layout, spacing, type, as well as common building blocks in the
form of components. So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two
pages.

Next, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.
We'll do so by including accessibility and responsive considerations all
throughout.

A [preview](https://deploy-preview-5--carbon-tutorial-svelte.netlify.app/) of
what you'll build (see bottom of page):

<Preview

  frameborder="no"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowfullscreen="true"
/>

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-svelte)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and
cloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and
do so by following the
[step 1 instructions](/developing/svelte-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).

### Branch

With your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial
step's starting point.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b svelte-step-4 upstream/svelte-step-4
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream
step 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this
step.

</InlineNotification>

### Build and start app

Install the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current
directory and not continuing from the previous step):

```bash
yarn
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should see something similar to where the
[previous step](/developing/svelte-tutorial/step-3) left off.

## Review design

Here's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and
three subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll
assume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning
it's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,
we'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.

![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)

<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>

## Create components

First we need files for the components, so create `InfoSection.svelte` and
`InfoCard.svelte` components in `src/lib`. The `lib` folder should already
contain the `TutorialHeader` component.

### Add files

```bash
src/lib
├──InfoCard.svelte
├──InfoSection.svelte
└──TutorialHeader.svelte
```

### InfoSection component

Let's create the parent component that includes the "The Principles" heading.
That markup currently looks like this in `routes/index.svelte`:

```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<Row>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">
    <h3>The Principles</h3>
  </Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Open</Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Modular</Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Consistent</Column>
</Row>
```

We want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component:

- Add component class names like `info-section` and `info-section__heading`
- Update the grid columns to match the design
- Replace `The Principles` with `{props.heading}`
- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `<slot />`

Using `props` we can render any heading and any number of slots (`InfoCard` that
we'll build soon.)

```html path=src/lib/InfoSection.svelte
<script>
  export let heading = '';

  import { Row, Column } from 'carbon-components-svelte';
</script>

<Row {...$$restProps}>
  <Column md="{8}" lg="{4}" xlg="{3}">
    <h3>{heading}</h3>
  </Column>
  <slot />
</Row>
```

At this point let's add styling for the `h3` element. Add a `style` block
containing the following CSS:

```html path=src/lib/InfoSection.svelte
<style>
  h3 {
    font: 'heading-01';
  }
</style>
```

### InfoCard component

Next up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently
looks like `<Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Open</Column>`. In
`src/lib/InfoCard.svelte`, add:

```html path=src/lib/InfoCard.svelte
<script>
  export let heading = "";
  export let icon;

  import { Column } from "carbon-components-svelte";

  $: [first, second, third] = heading.split(" ");
</script>

<Column md={4} lg={4} xlg={{ span: 3, offset: 1 }} class="info-card">
  <h4>
    {first}
    {second} <strong>{third}</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    <slot />
  </p>
  <svelte:component this={icon} />
</Column>
```

In doing so, we:

- Added `info-card` classes
- Used `props` to render the heading and icon
- Used default slot to render the paragraph body
- Set columns to match the grid

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** At extra large viewports, we are using
`bx--col-xlg-3 bx--offset-xlg-1` so each column takes up 3 of the 16 grid
columns, with a 1 column offset.

</InlineNotification>

## Use components

Nothing is styled yet, but with our components built let's put them to use. In
`routes/index.svelte`, import the components towards the top of the file.

```javascript path=src/routes/index.svelte
import InfoSection from '$lib/InfoSection.svelte';
import InfoCard from '$lib/InfoCard.svelte';
```

While we're at the top of `index.svelte`, import the icons from
`carbon-icons-svelte` that we'll need as well. We don't need to install
`carbon-icons-svelte` separately because it is already a direct dependency of
`carbon-components-svelte`.

```javascript path=src/routes/index.svelte
import { PersonFavorite32, Application32, Globe32 } from 'carbon-icons-svelte';
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You'll notice that these 32px icons aren't the pictograms as designed.
The Carbon team is currently working on adding pictograms to the icons packages.
Until then, we'll use the biggest SVGs.

</InlineNotification>

With everything imported, replace the current:

```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<Row>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">
    <h3>The Principles</h3>
  </Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Open</Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Modular</Column>
  <Column md="{4}" lg="{4}">Carbon is Consistent</Column>
</Row>
```

With the new components:

```html path=src/routes/index.svelte
<InfoSection
  heading="The Principles"
  class="landing-page-background landing-page__r3"
>
  <InfoCard heading="Carbon is Open" icon="{PersonFavorite32}">
    It’s a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source
    movement. Carbon’s users are also it’s makers, and everyone is encouraged to
    contribute.
  </InfoCard>
  <InfoCard heading="Carbon is Modular" icon="{Application32}">
    Carbon’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. Its components
    are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination
    suits the needs of the user.
  </InfoCard>
  <InfoCard heading="Carbon is Consistent" icon="{Globe32}">
    Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component
    of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to
    ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.
  </InfoCard>
</InfoSection>
```

**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to extra large
viewport widths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further
styling.

</InlineNotification>

## Add styling

Here's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need
to set type style and borders.

![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)

### Layout

Starting with layout, add the following to the `style` block in
`InfoCard.svelte`.

```css path=src/lib/InfoCard.svelte
:global(.info-card.info-card) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

:global(.info-card),
:global(.info-card svg) {
  margin-top: 'spacing-09';
}

@media (down: md) {
  :global(.info-card:not(:nth-child(2))) {
    border-top: 1px solid 'ui-03';
    padding-top: 'spacing-09';
  }
}

@media (bp: md) {
  :global(.info-card:not(:nth-child(odd))) {
    border-left: 1px solid 'ui-03';
  }
}

@media (bp: lg) {
  :global(.info-card) {
    margin-top: 0;
    border-left: 1px solid 'ui-03';
  }

  :global(.info-card svg) {
    margin-top: 'spacing-12';
  }
}
```

Once you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at
the different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.
There are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.

### Type

Our `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font
sizes according to the design spec with:

```css path=src/lib/InfoCard.svelte
h4 {
  font: 'productive-heading-03';
}
```

Finally, add the declaration block to set `InfoCard` body copy styles and to
bottom-align the icons.

```css path=src/lib/InfoCard.svelte
p {
  font: 'body-long-01';
  margin-top: 'spacing-06';
  flex-grow: 1;
}

@media (between: 321px) and (md) {
  p {
    max-width: 75%;
  }
}
```
