Starting with our Vue CLI generated app, let's install Carbon and begin using
Carbon components. By the end you will have a Vue app that uses the UI Shell to
navigate between pages.

## Fork, clone and branch

This tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called
[carbon-tutorial-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue)
that we'll use as a starting point for each step.

### Fork

To begin, fork
[carbon-tutorial-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue)
using your GitHub account.

### Clone

Go to your forked repository, copy the SSH or HTTPS URL and in your terminal run
the two commands to get the repository in your local file system and enter that
directory.

```bash
git clone [your fork SSH/HTTPS]
cd carbon-tutorial-vue
```

### Add upstream remote

Add a remote called `upstream` so we can eventually submit a pull request once
you have completed this tutorial step.

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue.git
```

Or, if you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH with your remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue.git
```

Verify that your forked repository remotes are correct:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Your terminal should output something like this:

```bash
origin	[your forked repo] (fetch)
origin	[your forked repo] (push)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue.git (push)
```

### Branch

Now that we have our repository set up, let's check out the branch for this
tutorial step's starting point. Run the two commands:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b vue-step-1 upstream/vue-step-1
```

## Build and start

We have the repository forked to your GitHub account, cloned down to your
machine, and the starting branch checked out. Next, install the Vue app's
dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Your default browser should open up with an empty page that says:
`Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon tutorial.`

OK. So we made a small change to the Vue CLI generated app replacing the
HelloWorld component and replaced it with our own message and swapped out the
favicon.

## Install Carbon

Even though we installed existing dependencies, we've yet to install the Carbon
packages.

- `carbon-components` - component styles
- `@carbon/vue` - Vue components
- `@carbon/icons-vue` - Vue icons

Stop your development server with `CTRL-C` and install Carbon dependencies with:

```bash
yarn add carbon-components @carbon/vue @carbon/icons-vue
```

## Other dependencies

If you check out the file `package.json`, you'll notice a few dependencies
beyond those listed above. These were installed as part of the project creation
using the Vue CLI. These include:

- `vue-router`: Used to make routing in Vue apps simpler
- `@vue/cli-plugin-babel`: To ensure we produce well supported code.
- `@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`: To allow us to catch potential errors.
- `@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest`: To allow us to unit test our code.
- `node-sass`: To allow us to use the sass css precompiler.

NOTE: We could have installed these seperately but using the CLI to set this up
for us ensures a good base config for these dependencies.

To avoid having to add the `~` prefix when importing SCSS files from
`node_modules`, create a `.env` file at the project root that contains:

```bash path=.env
SASS_PATH="node_modules"
```

For the Windows operating system, use:

```bash path=.env
SASS_PATH=./node_modules
```

Then, start the app again. If your app's currently running, you'll need to
restart it for the new environment variable to be used.

```bash
yarn serve
```

The app looks as it did before. Next, let's add Carbon styling.

### Import carbon-component styles

In the `src` directory, create a sub-directory `styles` and add a new file
`_carbon.scss` to it. Then in `App.vue` edit the style tag to import it.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```scss path=src/App.vue
<style lang="scss">
@import "./styles/carbon";
</style>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

In `styles/_carbon.scss`, import the Carbon styles by adding the following at
the top of the file:

```scss path=src/styles/_carbon.scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles';
```

This will take a moment for the Sass to compile. Once compiled, you'll notice
that the Carbon base styling is applied (IBM Plex Sans font family, font size,
weight, colors, etc.)

Because any change to `_carbon.scss` will re-compile all of the Carbon Sass,
avoid making changes here unless instructed to do so. it is better to make them
in the component files or a seperate file if needed.

Next we'll create a Carbon `Button` to test that our dependencies are working
properly.

After the other imports in main.js and before the Vue instance is created add
the following.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript path=src/main.js
import CarbonComponentsVue from "@carbon/vue";
Vue.use(CarbonComponentsVue);
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This is a quick way to pull in all @carbon/vue components and register them for
use in your project. Individual components can be imported to a project or
component.

e.g. Instead of modifying src/main.js we could have added the following to
src/App.vue:

```javascript path=src/App.vue
<script>
import { CvButton } from '@carbon/vue';

export default {
  components: {
    CvButton,
  }
};
</script>
```

See the Carbon Vue Components
[documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/blob/master/packages/core/README.md#using-the-components-directly-or-individually)
for other ways to load components from @carbon/vue components.

In this tutorial we will stick to importing all of the components at once so we
can focus on our use of @carbon/vue.

Now open the `App.vue` component and replace:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/App.vue
  Hello Carbon! Well, not quite yet. This is the starting point for the Carbon tutorial.
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

with:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html path=src/App.vue
<CvButton>Button</CvButton>
```

or

```html
<cv-button>Button</cv-button>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Congratulations, you've imported your first component! You should see a Carbon
styled button on the page.

NOTE: In this tutorial you can use either tag format. The
[Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) recommend sticking to
either Pascal or kebab case. The examples from here will use Pascal case for
file and component names with kebab case in the HTML.

## Add UI Shell

Next we're going to create a Vue component called `TutorialHeader` to use with
the UI Shell Carbon component. Create a new directory `src/components`. In the
`src/components` directory, create `TutorialHeader` directory. Create the
following files inside `src/components/TutorialHeader`:

```bash
src/components/TutorialHeader
├──index.js
└──TutorialHeader.vue
```

### Import and export the header

In `src/components/TutorialHeader/index.js`, import and export our
`TutorialHeader` component like so:

```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/index.js
import TutorialHeader from './TutorialHeader';
export default TutorialHeader;
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** This index.js files import/export is simply a convenience to shorten
the path used to import the component and potentially import multiple components
from one folder. The folder also provides us a handy location to add tests or
documentation for the component.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We could have simply created a file src/components/TutorialHeader.vue
without the above benefits.

</InlineNotification>

#### Lazyness - VSCode users only

If you are using VSCode then you might want to add the following snippet which
will when you type 'index' generate an index file for you based on the folder
name.

```json path=javascript.json
  "index-file": {
    "prefix": "index",
    "body": [
      "import ${TM_DIRECTORY/.*[\\/]//gm} from './${TM_DIRECTORY/.*[\\/]//gm}';",
      "export { ",
      "\t${TM_DIRECTORY/.*[\\/]//gm},",
      "};",
      "export default ${TM_DIRECTORY/.*[\\/]//gm}",
      ""
    ],
    "description": "Index file"
  }
```

You can also use the following to create a skeleton component. To use this one,
start typing the word template in your template file and it will generate a
file, making assumptions based on the component file name.

```json path=vue.json
  "Vue_Component": {
    "prefix": "template",
    "body": [
      "<template>",
      "\t$0",
      "</template>",
      "",
      "<script>",
      "export default {",
      "\tname: '${TM_FILENAME/[\\.]vue//}'",
      "};",
      "</script>",
      "",
      "<style lang=\"scss\">",
      "</style>",
      ""
    ],
    "description": "Single file template"
  }
```

OK, back to using Carbon components. Let's make use of our Carbon UI Shell
components in `TutorialHeader.vue`. Set up the file like so:

```html path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue
<template>
  <cv-header aria-label="Carbon tutorial">
    <cv-skip-to-content href="#main-content"
      >Skip to content</cv-skip-to-content
    >

    <cv-header-name href="/" prefix="IBM">Carbon Tutorial</cv-header-name>

    <cv-header-nav>
      <cv-header-menu-item href="/repos">Repositories</cv-header-menu-item>
    </cv-header-nav>

    <template slot="header-global" />
  </cv-header>
</template>
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You can find a description of the different components used in UI
Shell in our
[carbon-componets-vue](http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvuishell-header)
package.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** When creating navigation headers, it's important to have a
`Skip to content` link so keyboard users can skip the navigation items and go
straight to the main content.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** It's important that the `TutorialHeader` has the Carbon `CvHeader` as
it's containing element, as we'll later be rendering `TutorialHeader` in
`App.vue` as a preceeding sibling of `Content`, another UI Shell component.
Those components need to live one after another for the UI Shell to properly
render.

</InlineNotification>

### Import icons

Now let's import the icons from our `@carbon/icons-vue` elements package. After
the closing template tag in the `TutorialHeader.vue` file, we need to import
each individual icon we will use.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue
<script>
import Notification20 from "@carbon/icons-vue/es/notification/20";
import UserAvatar20 from "@carbon/icons-vue/es/user--avatar/20";
import AppSwitcher20 from "@carbon/icons-vue/es/app-switcher/20";

export default {
  name: "TutorialHeader",
  components: { Notification20, UserAvatar20, AppSwitcher20 }
};
</script>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We've given our component a name here as part of the default export.
This is optional in Vue but very useful in the
[Vue developer tools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools).

</InlineNotification>

Then we need to add content to the `header-global` slot where we will use our
icons. These represent actions in the header a user can make. Replace:

```html path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue
<template slot="header-global" />
```

With:

```html path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue
<template slot="header-global">
  <cv-header-global-action aria-label="Notifications">
    <notification-20 />
  </cv-header-global-action>
  <cv-header-global-action aria-label="User avatar">
    <user-avatar-20 />
  </cv-header-global-action>
  <cv-header-global-action aria-label="App switcher">
    <app-switcher-20 />
  </cv-header-global-action>
</template>
```

### Render the header

Next we'll render our UI Shell by importing our `TutorialHeader` component and
`CvContent` into `App.vue`. Add a script tag if you don't have one, then update
it as follows:

```javascript path=src/App.vue
<script>
import TutorialHeader from "./components/TutorialHeader";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    TutorialHeader
  }
};
</script>
```

In addition to importing the `TutorialHeader` component, we have also declared
it for use in our template by adding it to the `components` property of our
component.

As our template currently just contains a `Button` it is still not rendering
anything more interesting so let's update that to include our imported
components. This should look like the following:

```html path=src/App.vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <tutorial-header />
    <cv-content id="#main-content">
      <cv-button>Button</cv-button>
    </cv-content>
  </div>
</template>
```

You should now see a styled UI Shell header and a button below it.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** We've also sneaked in use of `CvContent` which needs to follow
`CvHeader` to ensure the correct formatting. We could have included it as part
of a shell component with TutorialHeader but have chosen not to in this case.

</InlineNotification>

## Create pages

Next thing we need to do is create the files for our views.

Since our app will have two pages, we'll create two folders in `src/views`.
Clear out the files currently in the views folder and add the following folders.

```bash
src/views
├── LandingPage
└── RepoPage
```

Create the following files in the `LandingPage` folder:

```bash
src/view/LandingPage
├── index.js
└── LandingPage.vue
```

Create the following files in the `RepoPage` folder:

```bash
src/view/RepoPage
├── index.js
└── RepoPage.vue
```

### Import and export content pages

Starting with `LandingPage`, just like with our header, we need to export the
component in `src/view/LandingPage/index.js` by adding:

```javascript path=src/view/LandingPage/index.js
import LandingPage from './LandingPage';
export default LandingPage;
```

Next in `LandingPage.vue` we'll create our component.

```html path=src/view/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue
<template>
  <div>LANDING PAGE</div>
</template>
```

We'll repeat this process with `RepoPage`.

In `src/view/RepoPage/index.js`, import and export the `RepoPage` component like
so:

```javascript path=src/view/RepoPage/index.js
import RepoPage from './RepoPage';
export default RepoPage;
```

Then in `RepoPage.vue` create the component.

```html path=src/view/RepoPage/RepoPage.vue
<template>
  <div>REPO PAGE</div>
</template>
```

Awesome! We've just created our content pages. Next thing we need to do is
render them with our router.

## Add routing

Lucky for you, as part of the Vue CLI project set up we added vue-router. This
created the views folder and also added, `src/router.js` and imported that into
`src/main.js` for us.

We need to adjust it by replacing the contents of `src/router.js` with:

```javascript path=src/router.js
import Vue from 'vue';
import Router from 'vue-router';
import LandingPage from './views/LandingPage';

Vue.use(Router);

export default new Router({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      name: 'landing-page',
      component: LandingPage,
    },
    {
      path: '/repos',
      name: 'repo-page',
      // route level code-splitting
      // this generates a separate chunk (repo-page.[hash].js) for this route
      // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
      component: () =>
        import(/* webpackChunkName: "repo-page" */ './views/RepoPage'),
    },
  ],
});
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The landing page is loaded immediately, with the RepoPage loaded only
once needed. This is one simple way to create webpackChunks and is the default
suggestion from the CLI plugin for vue-router.

</InlineNotification>

If you click on `Repositories` and then on `IBM Carbon Tutorial` you'll notice a
flicker as we hop from one page to another. We can fix this by using vue-router
to manage our views.

Next we need to update `src/App.vue` to render these views.

In the template section remove the `<cv-button />` and replace it with
`<router-view />` as follows

```html path=src/App.vue
<cv-content id="#main-content">
  <router-view />
</cv-content>
```

After that we need to do a couple quick fixes to the UI Shell to have it work
with the vue-router.

In `src/components/TuturialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue` simply replace the `href`
attributes used in the `cv-header-name` and `cv-header-menu-item` components
with `to`. @carbon/vue will under the covers switch from use of an `a` tag to
`router-link`.

```html path=src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.vue
<cv-header-name to="/" prefix="IBM">Carbon Tutorial</cv-header-name>
```

and

```html
<cv-header-menu-item to="/repos">Repositories</cv-header-menu-item>
```

You should now have a working header that routes to different pages without full
page reload!

## Submit pull request

We're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step
and demonstrate a couple of related concepts.

### Continuous integration (CI) check

We have a `ci-check` script defined in `package.json` that verifies file
formatting for files that have been touched since the last Git commit with a
tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io). You'd typically also have that
script run your test suite as part of your CI build. Go ahead and make sure
everything looks good with:

```bash
yarn ci-check
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If the `ci-check` is giving an error, it's likely that some of your
source files are not properly formatted. This could happen if your text editor
isn't formatting with Prettier on save.

</InlineNotification>

<!-- The following section is outcommented because it is not working: the format
     script is missing from package.json -->
<!-- To get_ `ci-check` _to pass, run_ `yarn format`_ then re-run_ `yarn ci-check`_._ -->

### Git commit and push

Before we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:

```bash
git add --all && git commit -m "feat(tutorial): complete step 1"
```

<!-- Stephane: I can't see any files changed or commited from me in that directory,
     so I wonder if we should mention it. -->
<!-- _Note: You'll notice that your commit includes binaries in the _`.yarn-offline-mirror`_ folder. That's expected as the repository is configured to run [Yarn offline](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/offline-mirror) for more reliable builds. Future tutorial steps that don't install new packages won't have _`.yarn-offline-mirror`_ commit changes._ -->

Then, push to your repository:

```bash
git push origin vue-step-1
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If your Git remote protocol is HTTPS instead of SSH, you may be
prompted to authenticate with GitHub when you push changes. If your GitHub
account has two-factor authentication enabled, we recommend that you follow
these instructions to
[create a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
That lets you use your token instead of password when performing Git operations
over HTTPS.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If you receive a `non-fast-forward` error, it's likely that your
forked repository is behind the original repository and needs updated. This can
happen if the tutorial was updated after you began working on it. To fix, run
`git pull upstream vue-step-1` to merge the changes into your branch, then you
can try pushing again. Or, you can
[manually merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) in the
upstream changes.

</InlineNotification>

### Pull request (PR)

Finally, visit
[carbon-tutorial-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue)
to "Compare & create pull request". In doing so, make sure that you are
comparing your repository's `vue-step-1` branch into `base: vue-step-1`. Take
notice of the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) bot that deploys a preview of
your PR every time that you push new commits. These previews can be shared and
viewed by anybody to assist the PR review process.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but
not merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches
pristine and ready for the next person!

</InlineNotification>
