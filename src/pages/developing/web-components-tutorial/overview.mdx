Welcome to Carbon! This tutorial will guide you in creating a Vanilla JS/HTML
app using Web Components from the Carbon Design System. We'll teach you the ins
and outs of using Carbon components, while introducing web development best
practices along the way.

Web components are native custom components based on standards that can be used
in any modern browser with any JavaScript library or framework just like plain
HTML elements.

For more information
[see Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction).

## Audience

This tutorial is intended for people with all amounts of web development
experience. If you want to jump straight to code, you may want to skip this
tutorial and go to the [developers getting started](/developing/get-started)
page.

## Prerequisites

### HTML

This is a web development tutorial that uses HTML. If you're not sure that you
are quite ready then hop over to
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

### SCSS (CSS preprocessor)

This tutorial uses SASS, or rather the CSS styled flavour called SCSS. If you
need help with CSS then head to
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). For help with SCSS head
to [sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/guide/).

### ECMAScript (Javascript)

Javascript is fundemental to adding interaction to your HTML. There are many
great resources out there, such as
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), which is more than enough
for everything in this tutorial.

### GitHub

We'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make
sure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their
[getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a
great way to learn GitHub.

### Pnpm

This tutorial uses [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management as that
was the default for `create-vite`. Make sure that you have
[Pnpm installed](https://pnpm.io/installation) prior to starting the tutorial so
you can follow along step-by-step.

## Outline

Each step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web
applications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can pick up
any step and take it from there.

1. [**Installing Carbon**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-1)
   - Create a web app with the UI shell component.
2. [**Building pages**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-2)
   - Build pages with the grid and various components.
3. [**Using APIs**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-3)
   - Populate the data table with an external data source.
4. [**Creating components**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-4)
   - Extend Carbon by creating your own components.
5. [**Deploying**](/developing/web-components-tutorial/step-5)
   - Build and host your app in a production environment.
