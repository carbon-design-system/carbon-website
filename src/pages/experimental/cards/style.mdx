## Color

For general card usage, use a white card when the page background color is **gray 10**.

If you need to draw attention to a card with unique content such as a special offering on the catalog page, use a **gray 90** or gradient color background for the card. Please refrain from using marketing messages that may cause the user to percieve the card as an advertisement.
