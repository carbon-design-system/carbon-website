## Launching a bot (Experimental)

Bots should be launched from a button positioned at the bottom right of the screen, or from a button embedded within the UI. See Carbon Chatbot Add-on Design Kit for the appropriate variants and the Motion tab for duration and easing curves.

Use a _landing page_ to first introduce the user to capabilities of your product, suggest common intents, or link to other ways of connecting with the main product.

When a landing page is not used, be sure to welcome the user to the product first.

## Error notifications (Experimental)

Be sure to indicate to a user when their message has not been sent due to a connectivity or server problem. When in a connected state, temporarily show the success notification, and then remove it along with any message error indicators.
