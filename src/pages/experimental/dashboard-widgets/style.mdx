## Specs

### Padding

The widget padding should be 1.5rem (24px) for the top, left, right, and bottom of the content area. All widgets should have the same padding, regardless of size.

### Lists

You can style lists with or without rulers separating the rows. In both cases, spacing between the rows should be 32 pixels.

## States

Widgets have five distinct states, each with their own styling: <b>normal, empty, permission, error,</b> and <b>loading</b>.

- In the normal state, text is left-aligned except for calls to action
- In every other state, content is center-aligned with an illustration and small, grey text

### Normal state

The normal state is the primary state. It occurs when a widget has been populated with data that the user has permission to see.

### Empty state

The empty state occurs when the user has no data to populate the widget.

### Permission state

This state occurs when a user does not have permission to see the widget data. For example a user may not have permission to manage other users or view usage data.

### Error state

The error state occurs when data fails to load.

### Loading state

The loading state appears while the widget data loads. Static headers are displayed as text and loading content is replaced by skeletons.

## Content

### Widget tiles

Each widget has a tile that can be seen when users open the "Add widget" side panel during dashboard customization. Each tile features the <b>widget icon</b>, <b>widget title</b>, and <b>short description</b> (max characters: 35).

### Illustrations

All dashboard illustrations should be 72x72px and should match the illustration style of these [sample dashboard illustrations](https://ibm.box.com/s/f2efq7ylbuwlfwnpwdqzk45c6mkz17bc).
