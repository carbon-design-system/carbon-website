## Anatomy

Each widget has a title bar and a content section. The title bar is standard for all widgets, but the content section varies depending on the type of widget.

#### Title

The tile identifies the widget. Max characters: 23 (including spaces)

#### Title link

A title link directs users to a more complete view of the information summarized in the widget. The link's content should be as specific as possible (e.g., "View resources" instead of "View all"). Max characters: 15

#### Call-to-action

A call-to-action offers the user a quick action in the widget. The call-to action is optional and can incorporate a plus icon if appropriate. Max characters: 23

## Variations

Dashboard widgets have two possible sizes, small and large. The height for both sizes is fixed (310px) and neither widget is resizable.
