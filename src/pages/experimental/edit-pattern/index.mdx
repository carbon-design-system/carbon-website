title: Edit Pattern
---

<PageDescription>

Editing is making changes to a resource that already exists in the system.
Updating and editing should use the same behavior as when the resource is created. This should only vary in situations where the number of editable fields is significantly smaller or larger than during creation, or the context of current settings is required.

## Low-impact edit

For low-impact edits, allow editing with no warning. This approach is typically used when editing doesnâ€™t have a wider impact.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

### Modal

If an object was created in a modal, its editable fields can be made available in a modal. A modal can also be used where a small subset of fields are editable.
If enough fields are editable to require scrolling, use a side-panel or full-page edit dialog instead.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

### Side-panel

If an object was created in a side panel, its editable fields can be made available in a side panel. A side panel can also be used where context in the main view of the screen is useful in the editing flow.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## High-impact edit

Warn the user of the consequences of editing. This pattern is typically used when editing has a wider impact.
Inform users of the likely consequences of the edit to their system, and inform them that editing cannot be undone. Include a warning stage.

### Modal

A high-impact edit action of only a few fields can use a danger modal. A second confirm edit modal should also be inserted before the changes are saved. If desired, the confirmation modal can include a [summary of changes](#summary-of-changes).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

### Side-panel

If an object was created in a side panel, or there are too many editable fields for a modal, a slide-over panel can be used.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

High-impact side panel edits should also warn the user of destructive edits with a warning before changes are saved.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

### Full page

When an object was created in a full-page flow, or the volume of editable fields is high, use a full-page edit dialog.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

## Optional extras

### Summary of changes

Adding a summary of changes to the warning stage of a high-impact flow can help the user manage and understand all of the changes they have made.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a summary of changes in a modal](images/11.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Non-editable fields

When a small number of fields are not editable, display their set value in a disabled field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a single non-editable field](images/10.png)

<Caption>Example of a single non-editable field</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Where a majority of variables are not editable, consider using an option that will display only editable fields. In a small number of cases, make individual variables editable in modals.

### Success notifications

An optional success notification can be used to confirm that the user's changes have been saved.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>
