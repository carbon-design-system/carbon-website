### Delete / Remove variations

| Action | Variation       | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete | _High impact_   | Action can't be reversed and causes significant loss. The user types the resource name into the modal to confim deletion. |
|        | _Medium impact_ | Action can't be reversed and causes some loss. The user sees a modal and confirms the consequence of deletion.            |
|        | _Low impact_    | Action is reversible or very low impact. A confirmation modal may not be required.                                        |
| Remove | _Medium impact_ | Action can't be reversed and causes some loss. The user sees a modal and confirms the consequence of removal.             |
|        | _Low impact_    | Action is reversible or very low impact. A confirmation modal may not be required.                                        |

## High-impact deletion

A high-impact deletion cannot be reversed. The action would result in a significant loss for a user if done accidentally.

When deleting is high-impact, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- This action cannot be undone.
- An editable text field for the name of the resource to be entered

For high-impact scenarios, a user should confirm the action by manually entering the name of the resource. The 'Delete' button is enabled when the text entered perfectly matches the resource name.

Optionally a [Done modal](#done-modal), [Requested modal](#requested-modal) or [Notification](#notification) can be used to confirm the action (or a combination of one modal and a notification).

</Column>
</Row>

## Medium-impact deletion

A medium-impact deletion is one that cannot be reversed, but would not be catastrophic if done accidentally. When deleting is medium-impact, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- The action cannot be undone.

Optionally an [Optional passive modal](#optional-passive-modal) or [Notification](#notification) can be used to confirm the action (or a combination of one modal and a notification).

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Low-impact deletion

Requiring the user to confirm deletion is generally recommended. However, in low impact situations, or when an ‘undo’ option is available, user confirmation may not be required.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

## Medium-impact removal

Removing has a medium impact when the action can't be reversed, and could have some impact if done accidentally.

Text should tell the user the consequences of the removal and that the action cannot be undone.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a medium impact remove modal](images/first-view.png)

<Caption>
  {' '}
  Removal modals should include consequences of removal, and "This action cannot
  be undone" statement.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Low-impact removal

As removing does not destroy an asset, typically user confirmation is not required.

## Anatomy

### Optional passive modal

In high or medium impact flows, an optional passive modal can be used to signify the state at the end of a remove or delete action.
Some deletion or removal actions don't happen immediately, in these situations it's recommended to inform the user through the optional passive modal.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a delete successful modal](images/Requested.png)

<Caption>
  {' '}
  Use a success modal to show that a delete request has been made / is in
  progress.
</Caption>

![Example of a remove successful modal](images/DoneMedium.png)

<Caption> Use a success modal to show that removing is complete.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Notification

An optional notification can be used to confirm a delete or remove action has completed. This is useful when the action takes more than a few moments.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a successful delete notification](images/7_updated.png)

<Caption>
  {' '}
  An optional notification can be used to confirm the delete or remove action
  with medium or high impact actions.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>
