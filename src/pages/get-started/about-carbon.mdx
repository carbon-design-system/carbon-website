## Introduction

As IBM's official design system, Carbon serves a wide range of designers and
developers building digital products and experiences. It is maintained by a core
team of designers, developers, and writers based in the Austin, Texas IBM Design
Studio.

The goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and quality,
making the design and development process more efficient and focused,
establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing
clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.

The design system is built [React](/get-started/develop/react) first. We also
support core parts of the system in [vanilla JS](/get-started/develop/vanilla),
[Angular](/get-started/develop/angular), and [Vue](/get-started/develop/vue). If
you’re using a different framework, you can still build components by following
our guidelines for [other frameworks](/get-started/develop/other-frameworks).

## Guiding principles

**Carbon is open.** The design system is a distributed effort, guided by the
principles of the
[open source movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement).
Carbon's users are also its makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.

**Carbon is inclusive.** It's designed and built to be accessible to all,
regardless of ability or situation.

**Carbon is modular and flexible.** The system's modularity ensures maximum
flexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with
each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.

**Carbon puts the user first.** Using rigorous research into users' needs and
desires, Carbon is laser-focused on real people.

**Carbon builds consistency.** Based on the IBM Design Language, every element
and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly
together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.

## How we work

The Carbon team encourages adoption through guidance and training, community
development, maintenance, and support. The system is primarily maintained by a
core team and governed by an executive board of design advisors.

### Adoption

**We conduct training classes and offer certifications.** These cover
introductions to Carbon and participating in this community. Each program is
piloted internally and available upon release externally. We teach at
conferences, bootcamp labs, and wherever else we're needed.

**We engage the community.** We strive to be one of the world’s best design
systems and we’re always
[open to feedback](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=).
We communicate with you about Carbon's state and roadmap through GitHub support,
blog posts, and Twitter.

**Contributed components and patterns include a list of maintainers.** The
Carbon team triages and supports maintenance requests that do not have a
maintainer. Unmaintained patterns will be demoted to Experimental if the Carbon
team decides not to maintain them.

**We provide support for users of the design system.** The Carbon team engages
with users primarily through GitHub. A member of the Carbon team responds to all
issues and pull requests.

### Assets

**We maintain a set of Sketch libraries containing Carbon components and
patterns.** There is a funnel of contribution for rigorous Sketch symbols before
they are made available in Sketch libraries.

**Carbon supports multiple code implementations.** These reflect the
production-level design libraries. The frameworks are listed below with their
primary maintainers:

- [React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core team
- [CSS/Vanilla](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core
  team
- [Angular](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/): Community maintained
- [Vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue):
  Community maintained

**Design patterns are harvested from products built with Carbon.** These become
part of the design system. Teams can use these well-defined patterns in their
work and contribute patterns back to the system.
