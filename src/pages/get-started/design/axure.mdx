## Get the kit

#### 1. Install Axure RP.

To design with the Carbon Axure Kit you must have the latest version of [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/download) installed.

#### 2. Get the widget library.

The library contains the widgets for Carbon components, design elements and other common shapes.

Download the `.rplib` file to your computer. Open Axure and click the _Add Library_ `+` icon at the top of the _Libraries_ pane. Locate and select the `IBM Carbon 10.rplib` file.

## Start designing

To get started, familiarize yourself with the contents of the template and widget library.

### Start with the template

Create a new project document with the template instead of a blank Axure document by opening `ibm-carbon-template` and saving a copy.

In the template, IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono are included as web fonts in the Generate HTML settings and will be displayed properly on any computer, even without these fonts being installed locally.

The _Default_, _Paragraph_ and _Text Link_ styles are pre-configured, which allows text to be pasted from the clipboard or text link inserted in a paragraph to match the typography and color guidelines by default.

### Using widgets

Use the widgets from the _IBM Carbon 10_ Axure library installed in step two to start designing. You'll find the widgets located in the _Libraries_ pane in the left side panel. To add a widget to the canvas, click and drag it from the Libraries pane. All widgets come with _styles_ and _interactions_ already built into them.

To edit the text on a widget, double-click it or select it and press `ENTER`.

To change style properties of your widgets, use the _Style_ pane on the right-hand side of the app or use the _Style Toolbar_ at top of the canvas.

To learn more about the IBM Carbon specific Axure elements visit visit the [wiki page](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Budapest-Studio/carbon-axure-kit/getting_started.html).

## Support

If you are brand new to Axure, they offer [tutorials](<[https://docs.axure.com/tutorials/basics/getting-started/](https://docs.axure.com/tutorials/basics/getting-started/)>) to get you started.

### Releases

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When a new version of the library is available, you need to download the new file to replace the old one. Releases will be posted to the [GitHub repo](<[https://github.com/IBM/design-kit](https://github.com/IBM/design-kit)>).

If you're an IBMer, join the #carbon-axure-kit Slack channel to get notified about changes.

### Updating existing documents

In an Axure RP document, styles already in use in the document prevail when adding widgets from a library. The existing style in the document will be applied to a library widget when the widget is dragged onto the document canvas.

Replacing the library won’t update the widget styles in your existing project files automatically. Follow the manual process below to update the styles.

Import the styles from the library file into project documents using the _Import Wizard._

1. Open your project in Axure RP.
2. Go to `file` → `Import from RP file ...` and select the .rplib library file.
3. In the wizard, go to the _Import Widget Styles_ step, and select all custom styles. "Default" should **not** be selected.

4. Skip to the end of the wizard and click _Finish_ to import the styles.
