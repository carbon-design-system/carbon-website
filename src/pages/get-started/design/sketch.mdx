## Get the kit

#### 1. **Install Sketch**.

To design with Carbon you must have the **most recent version** of
[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) installed.

#### 2. **Choose a theme**.

There are [four Carbon themes](/guidelines/color/overview#themes), two light
(White and Gray 10) and two dark (Gray 90 and Gray 100). Each theme lives in its
own Sketch library. You can subscribe to as many libraries as you'd like.

#### 3. **Bring in additional colors and icons**.

Additional color collections live in the IBM Design Language library. Icons live
in two different libraries separated by size.

    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

<br />
<br />

#### 4. **Download the grid templates**.

Visit the
[Sketch library](https://www.sketch.com/s/3a3f3f2d-94d7-4c16-8e2e-88ba80a6382e)
page and choose `Download Document` from the right-side panel.

<Row className="resource-card-group">
  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="Download the IBM Grid template"
      href="https://www.sketch.com/s/3a3f3f2d-94d7-4c16-8e2e-88ba80a6382e">
      <MdxIcon name="sketch" />
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>

      <MdxIcon name="sketch" />
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

<br />
<br />

Open the file in Sketch. Navigate to `File → Save as Template`. You can now
access the saved grid template at `File → New file from Template`.

## Start designing

To get started with Carbon, familiarize yourself with the contents of each
library.

#### **Start with the grid**.

At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and
select your grid template. You'll always be able to find the template here.

#### **Icons and color swatches**.

Symbols from both the IBM Design Language library and the Carbon library are
accessible from any Sketch document. Navigate to
`Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System` or `IBM Design Language`.

#### **You're all set**.

Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to
Sketch to begin designing.

## Anatomy

See the
[Sketch library](https://www.sketch.com/s/557b75ff-67d3-41ab-ada5-fa25447218c1)

### Grid

The IBM 2x Grid is the framework for laying out all visual elements in Carbon.

![2x Grid overview](/images/grid-2.gif)

<Caption>2x Grid overview</Caption>

All designs should start with the 2x Grid template. Once you have
[saved the grid](#get-the-kit) as a template, navigate to
`File → New file from Template` and select the grid template.

See our [layout guidelines](/guidelines/2x-grid/overview) for a more detailed
walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

#### Structure

The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the
necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use
`Control+L`.

### Symbols

Carbon [components](/components/overview), [add-ons](/contributing/add-ons), and
[icons](/guidelines/icons/library) live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

![Carbon symbol menu navigation](/images/carbon-kit.png)

#### Library menu navigation

There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library
symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are
specific to the document in which they are found.

From the `Insert` menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Design System` to add symbols
onto your page.

Carbon symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols
from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates
as they are released.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you'll see the
variations and states of that component.

- To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your
  artboard.

- For even more configurablility, use the individual building blocks found under
  the `Items` folder within the symbol. Be sure your custom design adheres to
  our [design guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).

### Text styles

Text styles are based on typography rules defined by the
[IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/type-basics).

![Text styles navigation](images/text-styles-1.png)

#### Library menu navigation

From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System` to
insert a Carbon type token text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend
detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure

Carbon text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

- The first text style level displays [theme options](/guidelines/themes) (i.e.,
  white theme).
- The second level shows the [Carbon type](/guidelines/typography/overview)
  tokens (i.e., body-long-01).
- The third level selects the type color, which is labeled with a
  [Carbon color](/guidelines/color/overview) token name.

### Layer styles

Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

![Layer styles navigation example](/images/layer-style-1.png)

<Caption>Use predetermined overrides when possible</Caption>

#### Library menu navigation

[Color](/guidelines/color/overview) in Carbon is carefully considered, and we
discourage custom layer styles.

The first layer is the theme selection (i.e., 01 White theme). The second layer
is core Carbon color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them. The
interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state.”

## Info

If you're brand new to Sketch, they offer some great
[tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/).

### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we
make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in
the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as
possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the
previous version.

### Migration

If you're using an older version of Carbon, check out the v10
[migration docs](/updates/v10-migration/designers) when you're ready to make the
switch.
