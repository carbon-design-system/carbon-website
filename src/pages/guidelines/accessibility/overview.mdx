## Carbon and accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone.
All Carbon components follow the [IBM Accessibility Checklist](https://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/ci162/accessibility_checklist.html) which is based on WCAG AA, Section 508, and European standards. Carbon's patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users, even when using a screen reader or other assistive technology.

However, how you use Carbon also affects the accessibility of a product. Read this page to learn about accessibility in general. Then, while you're working, use the role-specific Carbon accessibility guidelines to help you make products that anyone can use.

For a product to be considered accessible, it should:

- Give every user the same benefits, regardless of ability
- Adapt to any user in any context

## Categories of disabilities

Disabilities can be thought of as a mismatch between one's ability and one's environment, and can be broken into three main types:

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| _Situational_  | A person with typical vision might struggle to view their screen in a bright environment. Or, a person sitting in a library may be unable to watch a video with the audio turned on. |     |
| _Temporary_    | A person with a broken wrist may not be able to type but will regain the ability when healed.                                                                                        |     |
| _Long-lasting_ | This is what people typically think of when they hear "disability."                                                                                                                  |     |

### Blind users

#### How they experience an interface

- May use a screen reader to experience interfaces
- May rely on Braille output
- Cannot be expected to use a pointer or mouse for input

#### What designers should think about

- Is visual information translated effectively into text? Can the image be understood through its metadata alone?
- When possible, test all designs through a screen reader.

#### How this applies to everyone

- As audio-only interfaces gain popularity through devices like AI assistants, users are expecting more and more from the audio representations of experiences.

### Low-vision users

Low vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes and can range from mild to severe. It affects approximately 4% of the worldâ€™s population.

#### How they experience an interface

- May use screen readers, screen magnifiers, high-contrast modes, and/or monochrome displays
- May have their browser font size adjusted to a larger setting
- May not use adaptive technology at all

#### What designers should think about

- Maximize the readability and visual clarity of content.
- Consider how relative proximity of information changes when a page is magnified.
- Follow [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/) and test with a screen reader to ensure the page is read to the user in a logical order.
- To get a better understanding of the various low-vision disabilities, we recommend using the [NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl) Chrome plugin to preview websites.

#### How this applies to everyone

- Users without disabilities sometimes need to view screens in poor lighting conditions. For example, imagine using a screen outside on a bright day. A higher-contrast design will make the screen more usable for everyone.
- Vision worsens gradually starting around age 40, and good contrast helps this very large demographic use your interface.

### Color-blind users

Color-blindness affects 8% of all men and 0.4% of women.

#### How they experience an interface

- Will not be able to differentiate between some colors on an interface
- Rely on non-color information to use an interface

#### What designers should think about

- Run your design through a color-blind simulator. If the design doesn't work, try another approach. If you're working in Sketch, we recommend the [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/) plugin.
  <!-- - To view best practices for using color in Data Visualization, view the [Data Vis](/data-visualization/overview/colors) color page. -->

### Deaf and hard-of-hearing users

#### How they experience an interface

- May rely on captioning and other alternative representations of audio

#### What designers should think about

- Find alternatives to conveying information exclusively with sound.
- Transcribe and caption all videos and animations that have meaningful audio.

#### How this applies to everyone

- All users can benefit from closed captioning. Imagine using your device in a loud environment or, alternatively, in a quiet environment when it wouldn't be appropriate to turn your sound on.

### Physical disabilities

#### How users with physical disabilities experience an interface

- May rely on keyboards, track balls, voice recognition, and other assistive technologies to interact with an interface
- May not be able to use a keyboard, mouse, or other pointer

#### What designers should think about

- Design for good keyboard interaction, making sure all actions are keyboard accessible and efficient.
- Learn how to navigate using a [keyboard](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-nav.html.en) and spend some time navigating the web, email, and digital products using only the keyboard.

#### How this applies to everyone

- Many users prefer to navigate interfaces with a keyboard and no mouse for efficiency. Good keyboard navigation can help everyone be more productive.

### Users with cognitive disabilities

These users offer a broad spectrum of concerns for design. Functional cognitive disabilities can include difficulty with:

- Memory
- Problem solving
- Attention
- Reading, linguistic, and verbal comprehension
- Math comprehension
- Visual comprehension

#### How they experience an interface

- May have limited working memory and need information to remain visible throughout the completion of a task
- May experience seizures when exposed to flashing content (epilepsy)

#### What designers should think about

- Designers should understand the danger of complex language, non-stopping or flashing animations and fundamental cognitive usability heuristics.
- Design in as linear a fashion as possible and focus on design heuristics that have to do with cognitive load and memory.

#### How this applies to everyone

- Best practices for cognitive disabilities benefit all users. Busy environments can tax your cognitive load. Aging adults may also experience a decline in cognitive abilities. Placing a low cognitive load on users reduces mistakes and improves effectiveness, regardless of their abilities.

## Global accessibility standards

- [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people of all abilities.
- Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG), which is the global accessibility standard.
