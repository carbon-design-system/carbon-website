## Numerals

For all UI content, save screen space and use numerals in place of words for numbers.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="You can add up to 8 connectors."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="You can add up to eight connectors."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

When writing large numbers, use commas for thousand separators (_19,500_).

## Dates

In your product UI, best practice is to localize all date and time data. This results in date and time data being displayed to the user in a format that conforms to their culture.

For example, localization of dates will result in the following formats being displayed:

- Month, Day, Year (United States)
- Day, Month, Year (Europe, South America, Australia)
- Year, Month, Day (China and Japan)

> In visual designs use US formats for any example dates and times shown - but do ensure that all data is correctly localized when the designs are built in code.

Guidance re date components:

- **Day**: If relevant, the day of the week can be included and displayed in full (_Monday_) or abbreviated to the first 3 letters (_Mon_).
- **Date**: The numerical date within the month (_1-31_). Don’t use abbreviations such as _st_, _nd_, _rd_, or _th_ for the day of the month.
- **Month**: Can be displayed in numbers (_1-12_) or written out in full (_September_) or abbreviated to the first 3 letters (_Sep_).
- **Year**: Displayed in 2 digits (_20_) or 4 digits (_2020_).

There are multiple valid short and long date formats. Designers should pick the most suitable format for the specific context.

Examples of date formats localized for different regions:

| Region: US                | Region: UK              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 9/6/19                    | 06/09/19                |
| 9/6/2019                  | 06/09/2019              |
| Sep 6, 2019               | 06 Sep 2019             |
| Mon, Sep 6, 2019          | Mon 6 Sep 2019          |
| Monday, September 6, 2019 | Monday 6 September 2019 |

## Time

In your product UI, best practice is to localize all date and time data. This results in date and time data being displayed to the user in a format that conforms to their culture.

> In visual designs use US formats for any example dates and times shown - but do ensure that all data is correctly localized when the designs are built in code.

Guidance re time formats:

- Use colons to separate the different time units (_14:30_). Don’t add spaces between the colons and the numbers.
- The 12-hour time format always includes AM or PM - with a space between the digits and the AM or PM (_5:30 AM; 5:30 PM_).
- The 24-hour time format is always shown using 4 digits (_05:30; 17:30_).
- The 24-hour time format runs from 00:00 to 23:59, with 00:00 being midnight and 12:00 being noon.
- To express a time range, use _to_ or use a hyphen. Don’t use _through_. For 12-hour time formats, include AM or PM in both parts of the time range (_The job ran from 7:30:00 PM to 7:32:12 PM_).
- If relevant, show the time zone, using the appropriate internationally recognized [time zone abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations) (such as _PST_ for _Pacific Standard Time_).

Examples of time formats localized for different regions:

| Region: US     | Region: UK   |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| 7:08 AM        | 07:08        |
| 7:08 PM        | 19:08        |
| 7:08:09 AM     | 07:08:09     |
| 7:08:09 AM PST | 07:08:09 PST |

## Currency

Guidance re currency formats:

- Use a currency symbol (such as _\$_).
- Then show the amount.
- Then display the appropriate internationally recognized [ISO 4217 currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) (such as _USD_ for _US dollars_).
- Don’t abbreviate a number to a letter, such as writing the letter K for “thousand”, or the letter M for "million".
