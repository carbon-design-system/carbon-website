## Content foundations

Familiarity with key IBM guidance is essential to creating experiences that are
consistent, that provide an interoperability of experience with other offerings,
and that represent IBM as a company.

The Carbon content guidelines are built upon and informed by the following
foundational IBM assets.

## Voice and tone

### Voice

Voice in writing expresses the core of a company's personality. Whether spoken
or written, one of the most important characteristics of IBM is our unique brand
voice. Our verbal identity must remain as recognizable to everyone as our visual
identity.

Understanding IBM's personality can help you reach for the best words as you
develop content.

IBM Brand Center offers the following guidelines on voice.

#### When IBM content is at its best:

- It has a clear point of view.
- It’s simple and logical.
- It builds on solid research, data, and analysis.
- It’s intellectually ambitious, expressing a bigger idea.
- It’s persuasive, not poetic.
- It’s confident, but not boastful.
- It only ever uses figurative language for emphasis.
- It elevates facts and outcomes.
- It engages the thinker by speaking like the thinker.

For additional guidance, please read the IBM Brand Center
[voice guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/expression#voice).

### Tone

Tone describes how the IBM voice is expressed, and as such it can adapt to
different situations. For example, the words chosen for error messages differ
greatly from words you might see in an onboarding flow. The tone of error
messages is economical and direct, and they are often written in short phrases
instead of sentences. Onboarding flows typically take a little more time, with
full sentences and friendly explanations.

The underlying voice in each case is consistent but with different word choices
and a different sentence structure, the style and tone adapts.

## Conversational style

To set the appropriate tone, it helps to imagine the user engaging with the
product as if in a conversation. The interplay between words, images, and
interactions forms the conversation, a back-and-forth that takes place on the
glass, between the user and the product.

The conversational level is determined by where the user is in the journey, and
the task they are performing at that time. The most conversational content is
usually found in the "discover, try, and buy" phases of the journey. And the
least conversational content can be found in UI labels and error messages where
an economy of words is desirable.

IBM Style offers more guidelines on
[conversation style](https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W580a84a67242_4da6_81cf_69e3db4bdbfa/page/Conversational%20style).

## Writing for accessibility

For detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the
[Content design section](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents)
of the IBM Accessibility site.

It provides detailed guidance on the following topics:

- text alternatives for visuals or audio content
- errors and other messages
- labels and inputs for forms
- guidance for providing adequate context

Further guidance can be found in the
[Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
[guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

### Engineered

</Column>

<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should feel engineered with a strong sense of balance and
control. Precise use of the grid, along with consistent shapes, angles and
radii, help define a particular aesthetic that’s critical in expressing the
“IBMness” of our illustrations and reveals a well-considered and systematic
approach.

</Column>

</Row>

<Row class="narrativeTable">

<Column colLg={4} noGutter>

### Clear

</Column>

<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustration should never work too hard or be burdened with too many ideas.
Only essential, non-decorative, elements should be used to communicate the main
idea. Keeping an illustration simple and straightforward adds clarity. This
simplicity helps guide viewers through complex concepts, stories or scenarios.

</Column>

<Row class="narrativeTable">

### Nimble

</Column>

<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should display a sense of ease, lightness and nimbleness. This
nimble sense of composition, space, weight and orderliness will help the viewer
intake complexity with ease. A nimble quality also adds a great sense of
activity and liveliness in the illustration.

### Diverse

</Column>

<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

We take great pride in our commitment to diversity and inclusion and IBM
illustrations should be created in the same spirit. Gender, cultural and
geographical diversity should always be considered when creating illustrations
so that we strive for inclusion, representation and accessibility for all.

### Delightful

</Column>

<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should carry a sense of wonder and delight. While
illustrations are primarily used to explain or convey meaning, their delivery
can be more lighthearted at times. Lightheartedness means adding a sense of fun
that isn't overly humorous, but spirited, charming and appropriate for the
situation.
