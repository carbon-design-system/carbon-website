## Content foundations

Familiarity with key IBM guidance is essential to creating experiences that are
consistent, that provide an interoperability of experience with other offerings,
and that represent IBM as a company.

The Carbon content guidelines are built upon and informed by the following
foundational IBM assets.

## Voice and tone

### Voice

Voice in writing expresses the core of a company's personality. Whether spoken
or written, one of the most important characteristics of IBM is our unique brand
voice. Our verbal identity must remain as recognizable to everyone as our visual
identity.

Understanding IBM's personality and voice will help you reach for the best words
as you develop content.

IBM Brand Center offers the following guidelines on voice.

#### When IBM content is at its best:

- It has a clear point of view.
- It’s simple and logical.
- It builds on solid research, data, and analysis.
- It’s intellectually ambitious, expressing a bigger idea.
- It’s persuasive, not poetic.
- It’s confident, but not boastful.
- It only ever uses figurative language for emphasis.
- It elevates facts and outcomes.
- It engages the thinker by speaking like the thinker.

For more information, see the IBM Brand Center
[verbal expression](https://www.ibm.com/brand/expression/verbal-expression)
guidelines.

### Tone

Tone describes how the IBM voice is expressed, and as such it can adapt to
different situations. For example, the words chosen for error messages differ
greatly from words you might see in an onboarding flow. The tone of error
messages is economical and direct, and they are often written in short phrases
instead of sentences. Onboarding flows typically take a little more time, with
full sentences and friendly explanations.

The underlying voice in each case is consistent but with different word choices
and a different sentence structure, the style and tone adapts.

## Writing for accessibility

For detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the
[Content design section](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content) of the
IBM Accessibility site.

It provides detailed guidance on the following topics:

- text alternatives for visuals or audio content
- errors and other messages
- labels and inputs for forms
- guidance for providing adequate context

Further guidance can be found in the
[Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
[guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
