Well-designed content empowers people to use our offerings with ease. Words form
the conversation a user has with a product, working with the visual elements and
interactions to form a cohesive and tight experience.

These content guidelines have been developed from real-life examples to help
ensure the words you choose for your product interfaces create the best possible
experience for your users.

## Introduction

These guidelines are for everyone who is writing or reviewing copy in IBM
product interfaces. The best UX writing happens when content designers work
together with visual and experience designers, developers, and offering managers
ensuring that all elements of the communication are considered and tailored to
the goals of the user.

Content experiences will vary for each use case and persona, but the basic
guidelines for consistency and terminology hold true for all user types and
that's what you'll find here.

## Foundations

Familiarity with key IBM guidance is essential to creating experiences that
represent IBM, are consistent, and provide an interoperability of experience
with other offerings.

The Carbon content guidelines are built upon and informed by the following
foundational IBM assets.

## Voice and tone

### Voice

Voice in writing expresses the core of a company's personality. Whether spoken
or written, one of the most important characteristics of IBM is our unique brand
voice. Our verbal identity must remain as recognizable to everyone as our visual
identity.

Understanding IBM's personality can help you reach for the best word when making
choices as you develop content.

IBM Brand Center offers the following guidelines on voice.

#### When IBM content is at its best:

- It has a clear point of view.
- It’s simple and logical.
- It builds on solid research, data, and analysis.
- It’s intellectually ambitious, expressing a bigger idea.
- It’s persuasive, not poetic.
- It’s confident, but not boastful.
- It only ever uses figurative language for emphasis.
- It elevates facts and outcomes.
- It engages the thinker by speaking like the thinker.

For additional guidance, please read the IBM Brand Center
[voice guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/expression#voice).

### Tone

Tone describes how voice is expressed and it adapts to different situations. For
example, the words chosen for error messages differ greatly from words you might
see in an onboarding flow. The tone of error messages is economical and direct,
and they are often written in short phrases instead of sentences. Onboarding
flows typically take a little more time, with full sentences and friendly
explanations.

The underlying voice in each case is consistent but with different word choices
and a different sentence structure, the style and tone adapts.

## Conversational style

To set the appropriate tone, it helps to imagine the user engaging with the
product as if in a conversation. The interplay between words, images, and
interactions forms the conversation, a back-and-forth that takes place on the
glass, between the user and the product.

The conversational level is determined by where the user is in the journey, and
the task they are performing at that time. The most conversational content is
usually found in the "discover, try, and buy" phases of the journey. And the
least conversational content can be found in UI labels and error messages where
an economy of words is desirable.

## Writing for accessibility

For detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the
[Content design section](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents)
of the IBM Accessibility site.

It provides detailed guidance on the following topics:

- text alternatives for visuals or audio content
- errors and other messages
- labels and inputs for forms
- guidance for providing adequate context

Further guidance can be found in the
[Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
[guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
