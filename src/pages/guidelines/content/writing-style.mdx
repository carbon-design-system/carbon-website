## Capitalization

### Use sentence–case capitalization

Use sentence–case capitalization for all UI text elements. This style is
predominantly lowercase. Capitalize only the initial letter of the first word in
the text and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns. For
example, labels in a form would be written as “First name” and “Email address”.

The image below shows a page title, tabs, a module title, link text, button
text, table headers, and table content all following the sentence case rule.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Sentence case for UI elements](/images/sentence_case_786.png)

<Caption>Example of a product page using sentence–style capitalization</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Sentence–style capitalization makes it easy for readers to distinguish between
common nouns and proper nouns, and is generally considered the quickest form to
read.

> Do not capitalize the names of features and components unless they are sold
> separately or are trademarked.
>
> <cite>– The IBM Style Guide: Conventions for Writers and Editors</cite>

Carbon does not consider UI elements within a product to be proper nouns. Nor
does Carbon support a concept of “important words” or “specialness”. Determining
whether something is important or special is highly subjective and can result in
inconsistencies across an organization.

Unless the name is a product or service name, or is trademarked, always use
sentence–style capitalization.

In the following examples, the capitalization shows that Padlock, Visual
Recognition, and IBM Cloud are either products or services.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="Secure your enterprise applications with Padlock."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="Visual Recognition is a service on IBM Cloud."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

### Do not use title case capitalization

**Title (or headline) case capitalization** is where the first letter of most
words is capitalized, but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions (except if
any of these are the first or last word in the sentence or phrase).

Title case is difficult to implement consistently across an organization
because:

1. It requires everyone who writes any copy to understand and follow fairly
   complex grammatical rules about which words should and shouldn't be
   capitalized, and

1. It relies on a subjective viewpoint of what is considered “important” or
   “special” and that viewpoint being communicated or understood somehow.

Title case can also slow reading and comprehension down as it is more difficult
for readers to distinguish between proper nouns and common nouns.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="Secure your enterprise applications with Padlock."
    caption="Only capitalize proper nouns, such as product names."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    text="Secure your Enterprise Applications with Padlock."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

### Do not use all caps capitalization

**All caps (or uppercase) capitalization** is where every letter is capitalized.

All caps capitalization has been shown to be slower to read (especially when
text is more than a few words) as individual letter shapes are less
distinguishable from each other—they are the same height and have no ascenders
or descenders. This style also typically requires more space in the UI per
letter than sentence case does.

In addition, it can be difficult for the reader to distinguish between proper
nouns and common nouns. In the first example below, it's easy to distinguish
product names from features whereas it takes longer to make these distinctions
when the text is in all caps.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="Get started with Watson Studio to build, test, and deploy your own custom models to iOS."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    text="GET STARTED WITH WATSON STUDIO TO BUILD, TEST, AND DEPLOY YOU OWN CUSTOM MODELS TO IOS."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

### When to use capital letters

Capital letters are reserved for the following:

- “Carbon” or the “Carbon Design System” (the name of IBM’s official design
  system)
- “IBM” or any other company or organization name
- Any official, trademarked product or service (whether from IBM or not) –
  unless they intentionally use a lowercase letter at the beginning, such as the
  iPhone
- Any initialisms (for example, BBC, HTML) or acronyms (for example, NASA, NATO)
- Any people
- Any country / place names
- When referring to any UI labels that are themselves capitalized
- When the word begins a sentence or phrase

If it’s not in the list above, it should not be capitalized.

Sometimes official company and product names use non–standard capitalization. If
you refer to any of these, ensure you write them accurately. Here are some
examples (all written correctly):

- developerWorks
- GitHub
- iTunes
- JavaScript
- WebSphere

### How to refer to UI elements

When writing about a UI element, use the same capitalization as used in the UI.
For example, if an input field is labeled “Name” then you refer to this as the
Name input field. Similarly, if a drop–down menu has the label “Country” next to
it, then it is correct to refer to the Country drop–down menu. Where a product
page is titled “My network”, you refer to this in writing as follows: “Enter
your network information in the My network page”.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="To enter network information, go to the My network page."
    caption="How to refer to UI elements in text"
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    text="To enter network information, go to the My Network page."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

### Capitalizing proper nouns

The names of people, places, and products are proper nouns and therefore all
take initial capitals. Examples of proper nouns are:

- Eliot Noyes
- IBM Watson Studio
- Paris, France
- Porsche Boxster

There are many words that can act as either a common noun or a proper noun,
depending on the context. So, you always need to think about how the word is
being used. Here are some examples:

| Word                | Used as a common noun                            | Used as a proper noun                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| agile               | The group uses agile tools and processes         | Debs referred her manager to the Agile Manifesto   |
| design              | Jodi works in the design organization            | Jodi works for IBM Design                          |
| editor              | Joe used a text editor to update the config file | Joe used IBM Flow Editor to define his data models |
| front end developer | Jane is hoping to recruit a front end developer  | Megan’s job title is Senior Front End Developer    |

### Capitalizing abbreviations

**IBM product and service names**

When referencing the name of any IBM product, use the official (full) name, not
an abbreviation or just the product name initials, unless a shortened name has
been specifically approved, as with IBM CICS.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="Experience WebSphere Application Server on IBM Cloud..."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont type="dont" text="Experience WAS on IBM Cloud..." aspectRatio="1:1" />
</DoDontRow>

Use all uppercase letters for well–recognized abbreviations. This applies to
both initialisms, such as IBM, and to acronyms, such as GIF.

- ASCII
- CAPTCHA
- FAQ
- HTML
- OK (not Ok or Okay)
- WDSL

If there's a chance that an abbreviation might not be known to the target
audience, it's good practice to spell it out in full the first time you use it.
However, don't spell out commonly known abbreviations, for example PDF, CEO,
AM/PM.

### Capitalizing all other words

Unless the word begins a sentence, phrase, or UI element name, don't give it a
capital letter.

Don't give a word a capital letter to denote “specialness”. If you want to
emphasize a particular word or phrase within a sentence, use italic or bold
formatting (but not both).

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="You can use a global policy to apply changes to all users."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    text="You can use a Global Policy to apply changes to all users."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

## Simple writing

### Use simple words and sentences

Use the simplest term that is appropriate for your audience. For example, use
large instead of voluminous, and use small instead of diminutive.

Be succinct, and keep sentences as short and simple as possible. Omit wordy or
redundant phrases.

TIP: Create a terminology list of words for your product that includes preferred
words and words not to use. This simple tool can help with consistency over
time, especially if multiple are writing copy.

Respect a user's time and make things quick and easy to read. Always trim back
to as few words as possible, although don't be terse.

We recommend avoiding terms of politeness such as _please_ and _thank you_ in a
UI as they can be inappropriate or offensive in some cultural contexts.

### Use simple present tense

Use simple verbs and tenses, and keep sentences concise, simple, friendly, and
punchy. Focus on the user's context and make content relevant. The more familiar
you are with their context, the better you can communicate without using a lot
of words.

If you need to use past or future tense, avoid verb tenses with the words have,
has, had, been, should, would, and will.

## Conversational style

To set the appropriate tone and conversation level, it helps to imagine the user
engaging with the product as if in a conversation. The interplay between words,
imagery, and interactions forms the conversation, a back–and–forth that takes
place on the glass, between the user and the product.

The conversational level is determined by where the user is in the journey, and
the task they are performing at that time. The most conversational content is
usually found in the "discover, try, and buy" phases of the journey. Probably
the least conversational content can be found in error messages where an economy
of words is desirable.

Whatever the conversational level, the writing should always be simple, clear,
and easy to understand. And keep the tone friendly, human, and inviting. Use
everyday language, not jargon. And choose short words to make the reading
faster, rather than long, impressive–sounding words. Put the thesaurus away!

IBM Style offers more guidelines on
[conversational style](<[https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ibm_style/conversational-style.html](https://ibmdocs-test.mybluemix.net/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=medium-conversational-style)>).

### Formal versus casual tone

While a more formal tone is often appropriate for technical and business
writing, a more casual tone is becoming increasingly accepted (and expected) in
UI and supporting materials.

- Don't be afraid to use **contractions** when they fit the context and improve
  the flow.
- Beginning sentences with **and**, **but**, or **so** is not always forbidden.
  When it allows for shorter scannable sentences they can be used, but do not
  overuse these devices.
- Use **exclamation marks** only positively, not negatively. Make sure you use
  no more than one exclamation mark in a context, such as a single window or a
  single Docs topic.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use exclamation points for positive messages."
    text="Your IBM Cloud account is ready!"
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use exclamation points for negative messages"
    text="You have reached your usage limit!!"
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

#### Terms of politeness

Often overused, these terms can convey the wrong tone for technical material,
and are not regarded the same way in all cultures. Use terms such as “please”
and “thank you” carefully.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use terms of politeness in a UI only when the user is being inconvenienced."
    text="Indexing might take a few minutes. Please wait."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use terms of politeness superfluously."
    text="Please create a subscription account to get full access to the catalog."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

### Can, may, and might

#### Terms of ability

These terms are often misused. Remember, “can” implies ability, and “may”
implies permission (and sometimes uncertainty).

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use ‘can’ to express ability."
    text="You can use the command line interface to update your app."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use ‘may’ when you mean ‘can.’"
    text="You may use the command line interface to update your app."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

#### Terms of possibility

These terms can also be confusing. Remember, when either “may” or “might” will
work, generally go with “might” to avoid confusion with the multiple meanings of
“may”.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use ‘might’ to clarify possibility."
    text="You might need more advanced features when integrating with another app."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use ‘may’ when ‘might’ will work."
    text="You may need more advanced features when integrating with another app."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

## Inclusive language

IBM is committed to eliminating language that supports racial, cultural, or
gender bias. It is critical that all words used in any capacity in product
offerings be inclusive in their language.

IBMers who are unsure about a particular word can search the
[IBM Terminology database](http://ibm.biz/termsearch), and can also
[submit a term for review](http://tlwi.w3-969.ibm.com/standards/terminology/feedbackform2.html).

For more information about this important work, see the
[Inclusive IT Terminology](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/inclusive-it-terminology/take-action)
site.

## Pronouns

Use the second person (you, your) as often as possible.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    text="You can customize the access role for this connection."
    caption="Second person is friendlier and more engaging."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    text="Try adjusting your search or filter options to find what you're looking for."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

You can use first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the
user or customer data, for example “My account” or “My usage.” However, in
explanatory text for the heading or label, switch to second person. For example,
“Your usage is calculated from the first day of the month.”

Where appropriate, use first person (we, our) to refer to IBM. For example, in
requests for personal information, such as name and email address, where the
user will benefit from knowing why IBM is asking for this information. Example:
“Why do we need your email address?”

Avoid third–person pronouns that are gender specific.

For more detailed guidance about pronouns, refer to the
[Pronouns](https://ibmdocs-test.mybluemix.net/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=grammar-pronouns)
topic in IBM Style.

## Active and passive voice

The _active voice_ is direct and emphasizes the subject of the sentence. The
subject clearly “acts upon” the verb (hence, “active”). For example, “John ate
the apple”. In situations where either voice will work, generally choose the
active voice for more directness.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use active voice when appropriate."
    text="Next, the admin configures access privileges."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use passive voice when active voice will suffice."
    text="Next, access privileges are configured by the admin."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>

The _passive voice_, on the other hand, flips the construction so that the
subject is secondary to the verb and object (hence, “passive”). Often, the
subject is not even included in the sentence. For example, “_The apple was eaten
by John_” or just “_The apple was eaten_”. Only sentences that contain direct
objects can be constructed in the passive voice. Thus, “_John ate_” cannot be
constructed passively.

The passive voice makes for a more natural tone in certain use cases. For
example, if the true subject of the sentence is a system, and the human is
secondary, passive voice can be acceptable.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont
    type="do"
    caption="Do use passive voice when appropriate."
    text="The database needs to be rebooted."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
  <DoDont
    type="dont"
    caption="Don’t use active voice when passive voice is more appropriate."
    text="Someone needs to reboot the database."
    aspectRatio="1:1"
  />
</DoDontRow>
