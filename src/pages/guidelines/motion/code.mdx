The Carbon motion package empowers consistent cadence and movement of elements across digital experiences.

If you’re using carbon-components there’s no reason to install the motion package separately. See our [get started](/get-started/develop/react) guide to start building.

## Get started

To install `@carbon/motion` in your project, you will need to run the following
command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/motion
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/motion
```

## Usage

`@carbon/motion` supports standard, entrance, and exit easing curves in two
motion modes: productive and expressive. You can access these curves using
either Sass or JavaScript.

### Sass

`@carbon/motion` exports a `carbon--motion` function and `carbon--motion` mixin
that you can use to access the value of a motion curve or include that curve as
the `transition-timing-function` for a selector. To use these helpers, you can
do the following in your project:

```scss
@import "@carbon/motion/scss/motion.scss";

.my-custom-selector {
  // Supplies the standard easing curve, using the productive mode by default
  transition-timing-function: carbon--motion(standard);
}

.my-custom-selector-v2 {
  // Supplies the standard easing curve, but with the expressive mode, on the
  // transition-timing-function property for this selector
  @include carbon--motion(standard, expressive);
}
```

Both the `motion` function and mixin support passing in the name of the motion
curve and the mode you want to work in.

### JavaScript

If you're using `@carbon/motion` as a JavaScript dependency, we export our
easings and a function called `motion` that you can use. For example:

```js
// CommonJS
const { easings, motion } = require("@carbon/motion");
```

You can also include this as a JavaScript module:

```js
// ESM
import { easings, motion } from "@carbon/motion";

motion("standard", "productive"); // Returns a string `cubic-bezier()` function
```
