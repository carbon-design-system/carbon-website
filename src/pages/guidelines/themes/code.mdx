If you’re using carbon-components there’s no reason to install the themes package separately. See our [get started](/get-started/develop/react) guide to start building.

## Get started

To install `@carbon/themes` in your project, you will need to run the following
command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/themes
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/themes
```

## Usage

You can use `@carbon/themes` in JavaScript or Sass by including this package in
your project. By default, `@carbon/themes` provides a set of color tokens that
are pre-defined for a specific theme. Currently, we offer the following color
themes: white, gray 10, gray 90, gray 100 .

You can preview all of the token values for this on the
[Carbon Design System website](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage)
.

### Sass

If you're project is using Sass, you can include this package and the
corresponding default theme by writing the following in your Sass file:

```scss
@import "@carbon/themes/scss/themes";
```

By default, the white theme will be initialized. If you would like to include
another theme, you can do so by calling our mixin. For example:

```scss
@import "@carbon/themes/scss/themes";

// Use the gray 10 theme
@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g10);

// Use the gray 90 theme
@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g90);

// Use the gray 100 theme
@include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g100);
```

Alternatively, you can set the global theme variable then call the mixin without
passing in a theme name.

```scss
@import "@carbon/themes/scss/themes";

$carbon--theme: $carbon--theme--g10;

// Use the gray 10 theme
@include carbon--theme();
```

Inline theming can be done by using the mixin. For example:

```scss
@import "@carbon/themes/scss/themes";

// Use the default white theme here

.my-dark-theme {
  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g90) {
    // Use the dark theme here
  }
}

.my-darker-theme {
  @include carbon--theme($carbon--theme--g100) {
    // Use the darker theme here
  }
}
```

### JavaScript

If you're looking to use these themes in JavaScript, we export a variety of
bindings for you to use, including:

```js
import {
  // An object of all themes
  themes,

  // Direct theme values
  white,
  g10,
  g90,
  g100,

  // Specific token values
  interactive01,
  interactive02,
} from "@carbon/themes";
```
