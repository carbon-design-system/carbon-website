If you're using `@carbon/react`, you probably don't need need to install the
themes package separately. See our [Carbon React](/developing/frameworks/react/)
guide to start building.

## Usage

You can use `@carbon/themes` in JavaScript or Sass by including this package in
your project. By default, `@carbon/themes` provides a set of color tokens that
are pre-defined for a specific theme. Currently, we offer the following color
themes: white, gray 10, gray 90, gray 100.

You can preview all of the token values for this on the
[color guidelines](/guidelines/color/usage) page.

### Sass

If your project is using Sass, you can include this package and the
corresponding default theme by writing the following in your Sass file:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes';

.my-component {
  // Use tokens from the theme, this will map to a CSS Custom Property
  color: themes.$token-01;
}

:root {
  // Emit CSS Custom Properties for the current theme
  @include themes.theme();
}

// Get the value of a specific token
$custom-variable: rgba(themes.get('token-01'), 0.25);
```

By default, the white theme will be initialized. If you would like to include
another theme, you can do so by configuring the sass module using `with`. For
example:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes' as *;
@use '@carbon/themes' with ($theme: $g100);
```

Inline theming of theme switching can be done by using the mixin. For example:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes' as *;
@use '@carbon/themes';

:root {
  @include themes.theme($white);
}

[data-carbon-theme='g10'] {
  @include themes.theme($g10);
}

[data-carbon-theme='g90'] {
  @include themes.theme($g90);
}

[data-carbon-theme='g100'] {
  @include themes.theme($g100);
}
```

Themes can also be extended with your own custom tokens:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/themes' with
  (
    $fallback: themes.$g100,
    $theme: (
      token-01: #000000,
    )
  );
```

### JavaScript

If you're looking to use these themes in JavaScript, we export a variety of
bindings for you to use, including:

```js
import {
  // An object of all themes
  themes,

  // Direct theme values
  white,
  g10,
  g90,
  g100,

  // Specific token values
  interactive01,
  interactive02,
} from '@carbon/themes';
```
