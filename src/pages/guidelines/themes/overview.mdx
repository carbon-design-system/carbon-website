## Theming basics

Themes are used to modify existing components to fit a specific visual style. By
using Carbon's tokens, developers can easily customize all of their components
by changing a set of universal variables, eliminating the need to modify
individual components.

### Theme terms

| Term    | Definition                                                                                                   |     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| _Theme_ | A collection of visual attributes assigned to the tokens in order to create a specific aesthetic             |     |
| _Token_ | A role-based identifier that assigns a value to a theme. Tokens are universal and never change across themes |     |
| _Role_  | The systematic usage(s) of a token. Roles cannot be changed between themes                                   |     |
| _Value_ | The actual style (such as a hex code) assigned to a token                                                    |     |

### Default theme

Carbon provides four themes as shown in the
[color usage](/guidelines/color/usage) page. When `@carbon/react` is downloaded
and installed, the components are preset to use the default (White) theme.

To use the Gray 10, Gray 90, or Gray 100 theme as your default instead of White,
configure the sass module using `with`.

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' with (
  $theme: themes.$g100
);
```

## Customizing a theme

The default theme acts as a starting point; from there designers and developers
can define how their own components and styles deviate from the default.
Altering one, some, or all of the default token values will result in a new
theme. The developer configures these new values by configuring the sass module
using `with` which can replace the values of the default theme or add new custom
tokens as well.

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' with (
  $theme: (
    background: #e2e2e2,
    text-primary: #ffffff,
    custom-token-01: #000000,
  )
);
```

## Tokens

With tokens, the code only needs to be changed in one place to see the effect
system-wide. Tokens are used across all components and help keep global patterns
and styles consistent.

All tokens come pre-baked into the Carbon component source code. Tokens are
denoted by the prefix `$` (e.g. `$layer-01`). Tokens can also be nested within
other tokens. For example, `$interactive` calls the IBM Design Language color
palette token `$blue-60` for its value in the default theme.

There are several token categories:

- Color
- Spacing
- Typography
- Global

The full list of tokens available can be found in the source of the
`@carbon/themes` package per theme for
[white](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/themes/src/white.js),
[g10](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/themes/src/g10.js),
[g90](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/themes/src/g90.js),
and
[g100](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/themes/src/g100.js).

### Color

Each theme is assigned universal color variables, which are determined by common
roles and usage. This allows for uniform color application across themes while
maintaining full styling flexibility. For more information, see the
[color](/guidelines/color/overview) page.

### Spacing

Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes small
increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level
designs. For more information, see the [spacing](/guidelines/spacing/overview/)
page.

### Typography

Typography has four categories of type styles (universal, productive, editorial,
and additional) that can be customized through tokens. These tokens are used
both within components and across layouts. Type tokens are determined by their
role across the system. For more information, see the
[typography](/guidelines/typography/overview/) page.

### Global

The other categories are global and component-specific variables. These control
more general styling of components, such as layer usage or border width. The
full list of tokens available can be found in
[the source of the `@carbon/themes` package](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/themes/src/white.js).

## Theming applied

The following example demonstrates the relationship between the different
themes. Each theme shares the same variables and roles, with only the value
changing for each individual theme.

| 1   | `$text-secondary` | Label color         | Gray 70           | Gray 30              |

| 6   | `$background`     | Page background     | White             | Gray 100             |
