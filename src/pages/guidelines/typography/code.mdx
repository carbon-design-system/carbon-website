If you’re using carbon-components there’s no reason to install the type package
separately. See our [get started](/get-started/develop/react) guide to start

## Get started

To install `@carbon/type` in your project, you will need to run the following
command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/type
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/type
```

## Usage

The `@carbon/type` package enables you to use typography from the IBM Design
Language, including the type scale and fonts, along with typography design
tokens from the Carbon Design System. It also comes with opinionated defaults
for type styles on common elements like `h1`, `h2`, `p`, etc.

You can use this package by writing the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/type';
// Include type reset
@include type.reset();

// Include default type styles, targets h1, h2, h3, etc
@include type.default-type();

// Include utility classes for type-related properties
@include type.type-classes();

.selector {
  // Include a type style
  @include type.style('productive-heading-01');
}
```

### Type classes

The `type-classes` mixin will output a collection of utility CSS that you can
use to style a given HTML element with type-related styles.

In particular, you can use the following classes:

| Class                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.cds--type-{font-family}` | Set the `font-family` property for the given font. This can include `mono`, `sans`, `sans-condensed`, `sans-arabic`, `sans-devanagari`, `sans-hebrew`, `sans-jp`, `sans-kr`, `sans-thai-looped`, `sans-thai`, `serif` |
| `.cds--type-{font-weight}` | Set the `font-weight` property                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `.cds--type-italic`        | Set the `font-style` property to `italic`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `.cds--type-{token}`       | Style the HTML element with the given type token                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Type styles

Instead of using a type scale, `@carbon/type` provides tokens that represent
what we call type styles. These tokens have a variety of properties for styling
how text is rendered on a page.

You can find a full reference of the type styles that are available on the
[Carbon Design System website](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/productive)
.

You can include a token in your Sass file by writing:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/styles';

@include type-style('productive-heading-01');
```

In addition, if the type style you are using has a fluid style then you can pass
in `true` as the second argument to `type-style` to enable fluid styles. For
example:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/styles';

@include type-style('token-name', true);
```

### Font-face

`@carbon/type` supports three font-face definitions that you can use to add IBM
Plex to your project. These font-face definitions include support for:

- IBM Plex Mono
- IBM Plex Sans
- IBM Plex Serif

For most projects, only IBM Plex Mono and IBM Plex Sans is necessary. We also
provide IBM Plex Serif if you are building an editorial or marketing project.

These font-face definitions are pulling the above fonts from Google Fonts. As a
result, they are not intended to be used as a production asset for your project.
While you can depend on these for bootstrapping your project, we highly
recommend using the fonts from the `@ibm/plex` package and hosting them on a
global CDN.

You can include each font-face definition by including the corresponding file
and calling its mixin. For example, if you wanted to include IBM Plex Mono in
your project you would write the following in your Sass file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/font-face/mono';

@include font-face-mono();
```

Similarly, you can include IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif by writing:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/font-face/mono';
@import '@carbon/type/scss/font-face/sans';
@import '@carbon/type/scss/font-face/serif';

@include font-face-mono();
@include font-face-sans();
@include font-face-serif();
```

### Type classes

The recommended way to style your application will be to use our
[type styles](#type-styles). However, we also offer helper CSS classes for
specific use-cases. These are also helpful when quickly prototyping a project.

You can include type classes in your project by writing the following in your
Sass file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/classes';
```

| Selector                  | Description                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `.cds--type-mono`         | Specify the font face as IBM Plex Mono    |
| `.cds--type-sans`         | Specify the font face as IBM Plex Sans    |
| `.cds--type-serif`        | Specify the font face as IBM Plex Serif   |
| `.cds--type-light`        | Specify the font weight as light (300)    |
| `.cds--type-regular`      | Specify the font weight as regular (400)  |
| `.cds--type-semibold`     | Specify the font weight as semibold (600) |
| `.cds--type-italic`       | Specify the font style as italic          |
| `.cds--type-<type-style>` | Set styles for the given type style       |

### Font family

`@carbon/type` provides the font stacks for all the IBM Plex fonts available.
You can access the font family information by including the following import in
your Sass file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/font-family';
```

The font stacks are available under the `$font-families` variable. You can also
access a specific font family by using the `font-family` function by doing:

```scss
.my-selector {
  font-family: font-family('mono');
}
```

You can also use the `font-family` mixin to automatically set the `font-family`
property for you:

```scss
.my-selector {
  @include font-family('mono');
}
```

You can see all the available font families in `$font-families` .

### Reset

An optional type reset is provided under the `type-reset` mixin. You can include
this mixin by writing the following in your Sass file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/reset';

@include type-reset();
```

This reset sets some top-level properties on `html` and `body`, namely
`font-size`, `font-family`, and some `text-rendering` options. We also map the
`strong` tag to the semibold font weight.

### Type scale

A type scale is provided through the `$type-scale` variable and corresponding
`type-scale` function and mixin. However, for specifying type styles, the
recommendation is to use [type styles](#type-styles) .

If you are looking to use the type scale, you can include all the scale-related
utilities and variables by writing the following in your Sass file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/scale';
```

You can access a specific step in the type scale by using the `type-scale`
function:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/scale';

.my-selector {
  font-size: type-scale(1);
}
```

There is also a `type-scale` mixin that will set `font-size` for your directly:

```scss
@import '@carbon/type/scss/scale';

.my-selector {
  @include type-scale(1);
}
```
