## Overview

Within Carbon, there are two type sets available for use with productive and
expressive experiences. The productive type styles were developed for product
design, and the expressive, more editorial type styles were developed for
IBM.com website pages.

The overarching rule has been to use the productive type styles for product
design and the expressive for web pages. For the most part, this is still a good
guideline to follow. However, over time we've recognized some situations where a
productive moment within an expressive experience makes sense and likewise,
although to a lesser degree, where a user may benefit from an expressive moment
within a productive experience.

Let's look at the differences between these two experiences to understand the
respective design rationales, and then see what opportunities are available to
create contrasting moments that best support the user with their specific tasks.

## About productive

Carbon Design System started as the design system for Cloud console and provides
typography that supports **productive experiences**.

The key drivers defining a productive experience are as follows:

- Users are focused on getting a specific job done.
- Interactions are more active, through inputs, forms, and controls.
- Users are embedded within the experience, often on one page, for awhile.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of time needed to
  complete a task and also the abandonment rate.

Given these considerations, a high information density is preferred. Keeping
content condensed is helpful to support focus on complex tasks. With this in
mind, the productive styles (\*\*link to typeset tables) have been carefully
curated and they create a series of clear user expectations about hierarchy.

## About expressive

Carbon for IBM.com is for the creators of [IBM.com](http://ibm.com) and it
provides typography that supports **expressive experiences.**

The key drivers defining an expressive experience are as follows:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading.
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form
  reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates
  and final purchases.

Given these considerations, larger type sizes and a more editorial approach
allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease.
As with the productive styles, the expressive styles (\*\*link to typeset
tables) have been carefully curated and they create clear user expectations
about hierarchy.

## Blending experiences

The rationale for having two experiences is to support users where they are:

- On web pages where long form reading is the norm, users would find the high
  type density found in products overwhelming and information difficult to
  absorb.
- In products where users are focused on complex tasks, the more dramatic,
  graphic use of type in editorial and marketing design would be distracting.

However, there are situations when productive moments within the website
experience work better, and where expressive moments in product can create a
desired impact or pause. And so it can be preferable to find that balance and
use the two experiences. It's all about purpose.

### Using productive moments within [IBM.com](http://ibm.com) pages

Our design work is no longer divided between productive and expressive. Here are
some of the places the Dotcom team use productive experiences:

- the global masthead mega menu
- IBM.com search
- commerce
- product configuration
- search/filter on catalogs

### Using expressive moments within product designs

In product, there are fewer situations where it makes sense to lift the user out
of the concentration afforded by the productive experience. You will probably
see more expressive type styles used on the journey into the product. However,
here are some places where you may see expressive moments:

- Walk me (need to verify)
- Empty states
- Catalog pages

## Guidelines

People unconsciously use type size as a signal of hierarchy, and therefore the
correct use of type styles is critical for clear communication in our products
and web pages.

Each type set has been curated to create a full range of type styles that work
together to create clear user expectations about hierarchy, within both the
productive and expressive experiences.

Type styles must:

#### Align to the space in which the user is working.

That is, the productive type set is used for product and the expressive type set
is used for web pages.

#### Match and support the user task.

Within each type set, there are appropriately sized type styles for each user
task.

#### Be consistently applied within a discrete task, component, or region.

Mixing type styles within a component could jumble the hierarchy and create
confusion.

Do's

-- For long paragraphs in product, maintain the correct hierarchies by using
body-long-01.

-- For long paragraphs in web pages, maintain the correct hierarchies by using
body-long-02.

Don'ts

If the user is embedded in a task, do not distract by suddenly switching to a
larger type style.

If the decision is made to blend the experiences, the use of type sets should
match the purpose and be contained to the component or region where the task is
being performed. If the user moves to a task where a more compact display is
desired, ensure that all elements within that task/component use the same type
sets.

Headings are a key difference between the two type sets and they should not be
blended. Do's

## Getting help

Switching between experiences is something that should always be carefully
considered. The use cases can be used as a guide for when one or the other is
appropriate. If you're still unsure, reach out (\*\*link to below) to set up a
