<PageDescription>

Carbon provides two type sets that support both productive and expressive
experiences. Primarily, productive was designed for product and expressive was
designed for web pages, but there are opportunities to blend contrasting moments
to elevate the overall experience.

The Expressive theme has been integrated into the Carbon Design System's core
library, and both the productive and expressive type sets are now available
within the one [Sketch kit](/designing/design-kits/).

## Overview

Within Carbon, there are two type sets available for use with productive and
expressive experiences. The productive type styles were developed for product
design, and the expressive, more editorial type styles were developed for
IBM.com website pages.

The overarching rule has been to use the productive type styles for product
design and the expressive for web pages. For the most part, this is still a good
guideline to follow. However, over time we've recognized some situations where
we can create contrasting moments that better support the user with their
specific tasks.

Let's look at the respective design rationales for each experience, and then see
where it makes sense to provide a blend.

## The productive experience

Carbon Design System started as the design system for Cloud console and provides
typography that supports **productive experiences**.

The key drivers defining a productive experience are as follows:

- Users are focused on getting a specific job done.
- Interactions are more active, through inputs, forms, and controls.
- Users are embedded within the experience, often on one page, for awhile.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of time needed to
  complete a task and also the abandonment rate.

Given these considerations, a high information density is preferred. Keeping
content condensed is helpful to support focus on complex tasks.

## The expressive experience

Carbon for IBM.com is for the creators of IBM.com and it provides typography
that supports **expressive experiences.**

The key drivers defining an expressive experience are as follows:

- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading.
- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form
  reading.
- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session.
- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates
  and final purchases.

Given these considerations, larger type sizes and a more editorial approach
allows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease.

## Blending experiences

The spaces we are designing for are no longer divided between productive and
expressive. Understanding the rationale behind each of the experiences is the
key. Experiences can be blended with what we call "moments" if the alternative
experience better supports the user purpose.

If your users are working in a product but pausing to read or scan for options,
an expressive moment can facilitate easy reading and/or create a desired impact
or pause.

If your users are on the website and reading, but then switch to a focused task
within the web experience, using productive styles within that component would
facilitate focus.

### Using productive moments within [IBM.com](http://ibm.com) pages

Here are some of the places the Dotcom team use productive moments:

- The global masthead mega menu
- IBM.com search
- Commerce
- Product configuration
- Search/filter on catalogs

### Using expressive moments within product designs

Here are some of the places the product teams are using expressive moments:

- Product home pages, also known as "world overview pages"
- Onboarding
- Empty states
- Log in pages
- Catalog pages
- Expressive cards

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines for creating productive and expressive moments.

#### Keep type styles consistent within a discrete task, component, or region

People unconsciously use type size as a signal of hierarchy, and each type set
has been designed with expectations about hierarchy in mind. Mixing type styles
within a component could jumble the hierarchy and create confusion.

#### Primarily align to the space in which the user is working

The productive type set should still be used for product and the expressive type
set for web pages. The alternate moments are just that, moments.

#### Match and support the user task

Within each type set, there are appropriately sized type styles for each user
task.

_When users need to focus on a task_ and are interacting through inputs, forms,
and controls, use the productive type set. The more dramatic, graphic use of
type in editorial design would be distracting.

_When users are learning and exploring,_ and interacting through impactful
imagery, layout, and long form reading, use the expressive type set. The high
type density found in products would be overwhelming, and information difficult
to absorb.
