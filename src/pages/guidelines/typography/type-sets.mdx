The Expressive theme has been integrated into the Carbon Design System's core
library, and all type styles for expressive and productive use cases are
available within the one [Sketch kit](/designing/design-kits/).

## Overview

Carbon uses type tokens to manage our typography, and these tokens sit within
two type sets. The productive and expressive type sets support designers
creating for a full range of user needs and activities across product and web
pages.

#### Base type sizes

The productive type set uses a base type size of 14px, while the expressive type
set uses a base type size of 16px.

#### Style naming conventions

Within **Body styles** and **Supporting styles**, the same set of styles are
offered, and an easy way to spot which type set they belong to is to look at the
suffix. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style
names have a suffix of `-02`.

#### Two heading sets

There are two heading sets, one for productive and one for expressive. The major
difference between them is in how they are implemented in code because of the
nature of the pages.

- The productive type set uses _fixed_ headings. Product pages have a higher
  density of information housed inside containers for space efficiency, and in
  these situations fixed type styles are a must.

- The expressive type set has two fixed headings, for use where smaller headings
  are needed. The remainding headings are _fluid_. Web pages need to be able to
  flex and work at different breakpoints, and the fluid heading styles change
  size at different breakpoints, and can extrapolate/stretch in between sizes
  for smooth transitions.

## Supporting styles

There are two supporting styles for use with productive and expressive moments.
Productive styles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles have a suffix of
`-02`.

## Body styles

There are two body styles for productive and expressive moments. Productive
styles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles have a suffix of `-02`.

## Fixed heading styles

The fixed heading styles are used for product pages where multiple containers
are used and space efficiency is key. Fixed means they are not responsive. The
type size remains constant regardless of break point.

Creators of web pages also use the fixed headings `-01` and `-02` where smaller
headings are needed.

## Fluid heading styles

The fluid heading styles are primarily used in web pages, and are therefore part
of the expressive set of type styles. These headings are responsive and the type
styles change size at different breakpoints. They may be used in product pages
where text sits outside of a container, and a blend of expressive and productive
type styles is desired for hierarchy and distinction.

## Fluid display styles

These display styles are part of the expressive set and being fluid, they will
adjust at different breakpoints.

## Fluid quote styles

These quote styles are part of the expressive set and being fluid, they will
adjust at different breakpoints.
