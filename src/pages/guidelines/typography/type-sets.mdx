## Overview

The type sets here support designers creating `expressive` and `productive`
experiences within IBM products and [IBM.com](http://ibm.com) website pages.

## Key differences

#### Base type sizes

Productive experiences use a base type size of 14px, while expressive
experiences use a base type size of 16px.

### Style naming conventions

Within `Body styles` and `Supporting styles`, the same set of styles are
offered. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style
names have an `-02` suffix.

### Headings behave differently

There are two heading type sets, one Productive and one Expressive. The major
difference between the type sets is seen in how they are implemented.

Expressive uses a fluid type set for headings. Breakpoints are set in the code
so that the type adjusts smoothly as it moves between breakpoints.

Productive uses fixed headings. In the product space, users are generally
embedded within one area that has multiple containers and denser content, and
therefore headings in the productive type set are fixed.
