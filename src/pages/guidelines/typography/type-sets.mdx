## Overview

The two IBM type sets support designers creating productive and expressive
experiences within IBM products and IBM.com website pages.

## Differences between type sets

#### Base type sizes

Productive experiences use a base type size of 14px, while expressive
experiences use a base type size of 16px.

#### Style naming conventions

Within **Body styles** and **Supporting styles**, the same set of styles are
offered. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style
names have a suffix of `-02`.

#### Two heading sets

There are two heading type sets and the major difference between them is in how
they are implemented in code.

- Expressive headings are responsive and the type styles change size at
  different breakpoints. The larger values have a taller line height and the
  smaller values a more condensed light height. Breakpoints are set in the code
  so that the type adjusts smoothly.

- Productive uses fixed headings. In the product space, users are generally
  embedded within one area that has multiple containers and denser content, and
  therefore headings in the productive type set are fixed.
