### Slack channels

_For internal IBM users only._ The Carbon core team maintains the following
channels and will provide support as time permits.

**Please try searching the Slack channel for your topic first.** Slack’s
filtering feature will return more targeted and relevant results. For instance,
if you have a technical question about the `DataTable` component, you could
search “DataTable” in Slack and then filter by the #carbon-components channel.

_Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the `/s`
slash command._
