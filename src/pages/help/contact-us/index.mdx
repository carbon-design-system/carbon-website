### Slack channels

_For internal IBM users only._ The Carbon core team maintains the following
channels and will provide support as time permits.

Try searching the Slack channel for your topic first. Slack’s filtering feature
will return more targeted and relevant results. For instance, if you have a
technical question about the `DataTable` component, you could search “DataTable”
in Slack and then filter by the #carbon-components channel.

_Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the `/s`
slash command._
