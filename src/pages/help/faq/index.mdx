## About Carbon

### What is the Carbon Design System?

Carbon is the open-source design system for all IBM software products. It is a
series of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating
unified product experiences.

To learn more about how we work check out
[What is Carbon](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon).

### Who works on Carbon?

Carbon has a core team of designers and front-end developers dedicated to
developing and supporting the system. Our core team sits in the IBM Design
Studio in Austin, Texas. There are also countless other designers and developers
who contribute back to
[carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components#contributors)
and
[carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react#contributors).

## Contributing

### How can I contribute and/or propose new components or ideas?

Check out our [contribution overview](/contributing/overview) to learn all about
the different ways to contribute. Thanks for the help!

### I see a bug. How do I report it?

First, make sure the problem is reproducible. Once confirmed, open an issue in
the appropriate GitHub repo from the following list. We will address the bug as soon as we
can. If you have a fix for the bug, please feel free to submit a PR for it.

For larger changes, please see our
[contribution overview](/contributing/overview).

### What can I expect for a response to my bug report?

If you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make PR for the issue
yourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as
possible; sometimes within two or three days, but usually by the following
sprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until they become a higher
priority.

Typical responses to bug reports will include:

- Need more info, can't reproduce the problem
- Won't fix, this isn't something we intend to support
- Confirmed, will add to our roadmap (Carbon team will fix)
- Confirmed, will accept PRs (need external member to fix)
- Need to include design to verify this behavior is supported

### What should I do if I find a component that isn't accessible?

First, refer to the
[Carbon accessibility guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) to confirm
that the component fails accessibility standards. If confirmed,
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)
in the Components repo and describe the steps to reproduce the problem. If the
core Carbon team confirms the problem, we will work to fix it as quickly as
possible.

## Creating with Carbon

### Which browsers are supported?

Carbon components are supported in the following browsers:

- IE11
- Microsoft Edge latest
- Firefox latest
- Chrome latest
- Safari latest

### What languages are the components written in?

Carbon is built React first. We also support vanilla JS, Angular, and Vue
implementations. Check out [Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) to learn
more about what you need to get started with Carbon implementations.

### Where do I find mobile components?

We are currently working on a Carbon mobile Sketch kit. This kit is a work in
progress but is an opportunity for you to preview what we're working on and
provide early feedback. Find the kit on the
[Work in progress](/whats-happening/work-in-progress) page.

### Where do I find the Experimental components and patterns?

The patterns and components that were in Experimental are now in the
[Community assets](/community/overview) section. Community assets include work
developed and maintained by the individuals and teams who use Carbon. You can
help elevate these resources by contributing feedback, code, and design.

Note that some of the content in Community assets is hosted on internal IBM
sites and is only accessible to IBMers.

### Where do I find charts and data visualization?

Carbon charts are in development and classified as experimental. Check out the
[experimental charts repo](https://carbon-design-system.github.io/carbon-charts/?experimental=true)
to explore the work so far.

These charts will receive an updated color palette to match Carbon v10. Visual
guidance and chart components are also in the works!

### Where can I find documentation for earlier versions of Carbon?

Every version of Carbon that is still supported is hosted at its own domain. You
can find the old sites version here:
**[V6](http://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,
**[V7](http://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,
**[V8](http://v8.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, and
**[V9](http://v9.carbondesignsystem.com/).**
