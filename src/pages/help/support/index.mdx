## Questions

The Carbon core team provides support for users of the design system. Find the use case below that most closely matches your own for the quickest response.

### Carbon website

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before engaging the Carbon team. The site is very comprehensive and most of the guidelines and components are well documented.

### Frequently asked questions

Answers to the most common questions about the design system can be found in the [Carbon FAQ](faq).

### Slack channels

_Internal IBM users only._ The Carbon core team maintains the following channels and will provide support as time permits.

**Please try searching the Slack channel for your topic first.** Slack’s filtering feature will return more targeted and relevant results. For instance, if you have a technical question about the `DataTable` component, you could search “DataTable” in Slack and then filter by the #carbon-components channel. _Tip: You can start a new search directly from the message box using the `/s` slash command._
