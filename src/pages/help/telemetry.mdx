<PageDescription>

Carbon contains a telemetry feature that collects usage information for IBM and
Carbon Design System properties.

</PageDescription>

### Why is telemetry collected?

Carbon collects telemetry information to influence Carbon's roadmap and
prioritize bug fixes.

### When is data collected?

Data is only collected when Carbon packages are installed on a Continuous
Integration (CI) server, when the installation is not part of a Pull Request
(PR), for Git respositories with the origin remotes:

- `github.ibm.com`
- `github.com/ibm`
- `github.com/carbon-design-system`

As the information collected is not anonymous, telemetry data collection is
limited to IBM GitHub Enterprise repositories, as well as open-source
repositories in the IBM and Carbon Design System GitHub organizations.

### What is being collected?

The following is collected through a postinstall script:

- Git repository remote origin URLs and commit hashes
- Packages and package versions used in the repository
- Components being used including file paths and their packages
- Component props being used (the prop value is only collected when it is
  serializable to a string)

### How do I opt out?

Participation in Carbon's telemetry is optional. To opt-out, set the environment
variable `CARBON_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` to `1`.
