## Welcome to v10

With Carbon v10 comes a complete refresh of the design system. The Carbon team worked hard to make the transition to v10 seamless, but there are breaking changes. This guide is for teams migrating from v9 to v10. If your team uses an older version of Carbon, some of this information may not apply to you.

## Migration strategy

#### Talk about migration early and often.

Have a plan. Meet with all relevant stakeholders from design, OM, and engineering to kick off the migration process. Establish dedicated channels of communication for migration, and involve the broader team as needed.

#### Migrate in a dedicated branch.

This update includes substantial changes to layout and spacing. The Carbon team does not recommend upgrading piece-by-piece on the production build. Product teams should perform the migration first in a separate branch (or branches). This allows the creation of new design specs for any possible rough spots in alignment or sizing that may appear in the UI after upgrading.

#### First things first.

The Carbon team recommends tackling components, colors, type, spacing, and iconography first. These updates should be relatively straightforward. Aligning to the new grid will be more design-intensive, and can be tackled after the other elements.
