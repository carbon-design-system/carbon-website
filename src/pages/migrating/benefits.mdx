  What are the benefits of migrating to v11 as a designer, developer, product
  manager or as my product's customers?
</PageDescription>

## As a designer

- Token names have been updated for easier application. Names are more logical
  and easier to apply without always having to refer to a guide.
- Nothing visually has changed in any of the components, and no redesign work is
  required.

## As a developer

- CSS grid provides easier implementation of layouts, support for sub-grid, and
  other features that come along with this new technology.
- CSS custom properties for theming (light mode / dark mode).
- A 90% reduction in compile times for most projects with the update to Sass
  architecture.
- Quality of life updates such as:
  - Consistent component API across the board.
  - Improvements to Sass structure for getting started and productive use
    experiences.
- New components:
  - Cover a wider variety of use-cases in your product with some of our new
    components.
  - Easily build our more accessible experiences with our accessibility
    component primitives.

## As a product manager?

- Developers working with Carbon will see faster compile times: reduced by ~90%
  and build times reduced by ~60%.

## My product’s customers

- Light/dark mode support.
- Faster load times due to smaller bundle sizes.
