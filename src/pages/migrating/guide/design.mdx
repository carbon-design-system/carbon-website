## Design kit

### What's changed

- Updated existing color token names to better reflect their usage
- Updated layer styles with new color tokens
- Updated text styles with new color tokens
- Removal of light variants (in favor of new layer and contextual token sets)

### What's new

- Added new color tokens
- Introduced layering models: layer set tokens and contextual layer tokens

### v11 Beta kit

Try out the v11 Beta Sketch kit that has been updated to reflect our color token
name changes and additional token layer sets and contextual layer sets. The v11
Beta kit is available in the White and Gray 100 themes.

<InlineNotification>
  Note: The v11 Beta kit is temporary and only available during our beta release
  timeframe. The existing v10 kits will be updated with these changes and
  additions once v11 is released to the general public.

## Components

### UI shell

The UI shell is now themeable and has been updated to use inline theming. The UI
shell uses Carbon theme tokens instead of component specific tokens and the
color will follow each themes styles.

## Elements

### Color tokens

Existing color tokens have been renamed to better reflect their usage. In
addition to renaming existing tokens, new tokens have been added to fill
existing color token gaps in our system and to fix complex layering logic. We
have introduced two different types of color token layering models—Layer set
tokens and Contextual layer tokens. You can choose to use one model over the
other depending on which one makes most sense to migrate to for your product.

See Carbon's
[color overview](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview/#tokens)
and
[color implementation](https://carbondesignsystem-git-fork-aagonza-f5b8b0-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/guidelines/color/implementation#layering-model-tokens)

### Inline theming

Inline theming is available to use in your product. Inline theming is used when
a section of a UI needs to have a different theme from the rest of the page and
allows themes to be nested within each other without needing custom styles or
overrides. In product, a common use-case for inline theming is applying a
contrasting theme to a UI shell and side panels.

See Carbon's
[inline theming](https://carbondesignsystem-git-fork-aagonza-f5b8b0-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/guidelines/color/implementation#inline-theming)
guidance for more information.

### Light or dark mode

Light or dark mode has been newly introduced and is a theme setting that allows
the end user to choose a UI that is either predominately light or dark in color.
The UI will automatically switch from using light color backgrounds with dark
color text to using dark color backgrounds with light color text.

See Carbon's
[light or dark mode](https://carbondesignsystem-git-fork-aagonza-f5b8b0-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/guidelines/color/implementation#designing-for-light-or-dark-mode)
