## Components

### UI Shell

The UI Shell is now themeable and has been updated to use Carbon theme tokens
instead of component specific tokens. As a result of this change, the component
specific tokens have been deprecated.

## Elements

### Color

**Color tokens**

Existing color tokens have been renamed to better reflect their usage. The token
names are divided into parts to help you make decisions and understand options.
The first part of the token name references the general UI element the color is
being applied to. If the element can be styled in more than one way then the
last half of the token name will further describe how it should be used.

In addition to renaming existing tokens, new tokens have been added to fill
existing color token gaps in our system and to fix complex layering logic.

We have also introduced two different types of layering modelsâ€”Layer set tokens
and Contextual layer tokens. You can choose to use one model over another
depending on what makes most sense to migrate to for your product.

See Carbon's
[color usage](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview/#tokens)
guidance for more information.

**Hover colors**

Hover colors have been updated to follow a lighten and darken approach. Hover
values fall outside of the IBM color palette steps and are calculated in code
through an adjustLightness function with either a + or - number value. Note that
in the Sketch assets, hex codes are still used as values for hover states for
ease of use and are built into the layer style tokens.

See Carbon's
[interaction states](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview/#interaction-states)
guidance for more information.
