## Overview

This guide helps you update your project to Carbon v11. This guide is broken
into sections based on packages that you are using in your project today. For
most teams using Carbon, you'll want to use the
[`carbon-components-react`](#carbon-components-react) section.

One of the biggest changes coming to Carbon in v11 is that we are moving to
dedicated packages under the `@carbon` scope. What this means for you is that if
you previously were using the following packages:

- `carbon-components`
- `carbon-components-react`
- `carbon-icons`
- `@carbon/icons-react`

You can access all of this work under one single package: `@carbon/react`. This
package will re-export all of the styles and icons for Carbon all in one
dependency.

If you were previously using `carbon-components`, the styles from this package
are available under `@carbon/styles`. They are also re-exported through
`@carbon/react`

Both the `carbon-components` and `carbon-components-react` packages will stick
around in v11 but they will only be re-exports of `@carbon/styles` and
`@carbon/react` respectively.

For a full list of changes, checkout our [Migration Docs](#todo).

### Grid

### Notification

We have updated the notification components to be more accessible out of the
box. `ToastNotification` and `InlineNotification` now have `role="status"` by
default with additional `role` options of `log` and `alert`. These components do
not receive focus and should be used for information-only use cases. These
components no longer accept actions or interactive children.

For notifications requiring an action, a new `ActionableNotifiation` component
is available. It has a `role="alertdialog"` and recieves focus by default.
Automatic placement of focus can be turned off via the new `hasFocus` prop.

All notifications have a new optional `closeOnEscape` prop, it enables
notifications to closed by pressing the `escape` key. For more details, see the
[notification components accessibility page](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/accessibility).

#### What this means for you and your team

- Notifications will be WAI-ARIA compliant out of the box without the explicit
  need for additional functionality or configuration

#### How to migrate

##### Update `ToastNotification` usage

- The `title`, `subtitle` and `caption` props have been removed. Compose
  notification contents using `children` instead.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements. A `ToastNotification`
  containing an action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification`.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

##### Update `InlineNotification` usage

- The `title`, `subtitle` props have been removed. Compose notification contents
  using `children` instead.
- The `actions` prop has been removed. An `InlineNotification` containing an
  action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification` configured with the `inline` prop.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

##### When using `ActionableNotification`:

- The `inline` prop enables a styling variation resulting in a similar visual
  design to `InlineNotification`.
- The `actionButtonLabel` prop configures the action button text.
- The `hasFocus` prop toggles the automatic placement of focus.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

## carbon-components

Starting in v11, the styles for Carbon live in the `@carbon/styles` package.
Alternatively, you can continue to use `carbon-components` as it re-exports
styles from this package directly.

_Note: if you are using `carbon-components-react`, you can bring in styles
directly from the new package `@carbon/react`. To learn more, visit the
[`carbon-components-react`](#carbon-components-react) section_

### Step 1

To get started, uninstall `carbon-components` from your project:

```bash
npm uninstall carbon-components
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn remove carbon-components
```

Next, install the `@carbon/styles` package:

```bash
npm install @carbon/styles
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add @carbon/styles
```

### Step 2

Previously, `carbon-components` supported being compiled by different Sass
libraries. Starting in v11, the `@carbon/styles` package requires Dart Sass
through the `sass` package in order to compile. This change comes due to our
migration over to Sass Modules in order to improve our compilation times and
overall project structure.

If you don't have this dependency already in your project, you can install it:

```bash
npm install sass
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add sass
```

Similarly, if you currently use `node-sass` now is a good time to remove that
dependency from your project. In most situations, Dart Sass is a drop-in
replacement for `node-sass` and should require no changes on your end in order
to use it once you install the dependency.

### Step 3

One you have Dart Sass installed, it's important that you configure your project
to support resolving imports in Sass from `node_modules`. Typically, this means
adding `node_modules` to your `includePaths` config for Sass in your bundler or
toolchain of choice.

To learn more about how to configure your specific toolchain to support this,
read the documentation for configuration
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/styles/docs/sass.md#configuration).

### Step 4

In v10, you may have been bringing in styles from `carbon-components` by either
importing the styles directly with:

```scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

Or, you imported the styles through specific entrypoints:

```scss
// Feature flags
$feature-flags: (
  enable-columns-16: true,
);
// Options
$css--default-type: true;
$css--reset: true;
// Top-level imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vars';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/colors';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/theme';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/spacing';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--reset';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--body';
// Component imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion/accordion';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/button/button';
```

If you imported the entrypoint from `carbon-components`, you can now do this
directly from `@carbon/styles` without any additional paths by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles';
```

If you were providing any configuration options before you imported Carbon you
can now provide them using the `with` syntax:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
```

If you were using any feature flags in v10, you can safely remove them in v11.

_Note: you can also use `@import` to bring in Carbon, if you prefer, although
`@use` is recommended._

If you were bringing parts of Carbon, you'll need to update the paths to reflect
the new paths in `@carbon/styles`. In general, most paths moved from
`scss/globals/scss/filename` to `scss/filename`.

```scss
// Configuratoin
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with
  ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
// Reset
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/reset';
// Grid
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid';
// Helpers
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/spacing';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/type';
// Components
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/button';
```

For a full list of the paths that have changed in `carbon-components`, check out
our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss).

### Step 5

If you were using specific variables, mixins, or functions from Carbon, it may
be that you will need to update their name in v11. In general, all `carbon--`
prefixed names have been renamed to drop the `carbon--` prefix.

For a full list of the changes to variables, mixins, and functions that have
changed, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss)
and find the specific file that you were importing from.

### Step 6

If you are targeting specific selectors that use the `bx` prefix, you will need
to update your code to either target the `cds` prefix for selectors or update
Carbon's configuration to use `bx` as the prefix by writing the following:

```scss
// Option A
@use '@carbon/styles' with ($prefix: 'bx');
// Option B
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with ($prefix: 'bx');
```

### Step 7

If you are using the flexbox-based grid in your project, you can continue to use
this feature in v11 by importing the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid/flexbox';
```

This is important due to the fact that the CSS Grid implementation is used by
default in v11. However, bringing in the flexbox grid styles in this way means
that your layouts will continue to work the same as in v10.

### Step 8

If you are using color tokens from Carbon, you can either update to use the new
tokens in v11 or use the compatability theme for incremental adoption of the new
tokens while maintaining existing work from v10.

For an overview of the changes to tokens, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#design-tokens).

If you would like to use the compatability theme, you can write the following in
your project where you are currently bringing in theme:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/compat/themes' as compat;
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/theme' with
  ($fallback: compat.$g100, $theme: themes.$g100);
```

Doing this will allow you to use tokens from the g100 theme in v10 along with
the tokens in v11. This will work for any of the themes in v10 including white,
g10, g90, and g100.

### Step 9

And that's it! You're done. At this point you have migrated to use Carbon v11
using the `@carbon/styles` package.

If you run into any problems after this point, pleasefeel free to reach out to
us over on Slack or open up a discussion on
[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions/categories/help).
We want to make this migration experience as seamless as possible and will be
monitoring both areas to help out.

## carbon-icons

The `carbon-icons` package has been deprecated and is no longer supported. To
use icons from the Carbon Design System, you should install the appropriate
library to use with your framework:

| Package                 | Framework          | Link                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@carbon/icons-react`   | React              | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-react)   |
| `@carbon/icons-angular` | Angular            | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-angular) |
| `@carbon/icons-vue`     | Vue                | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-vue)     |
| `carbon-icons-svelte`   | Svelte             | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/carbon-icons-svelte)   |
| `@carbon/icons`         | Vanilla JavaScript | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons)         |

If you are using `@carbon/react`, you can directly import icons from
`@carbon/react/icons`.

## Elements

The packages that we ship for the IBM Design Language have been updated in v11.
The most notable change is that these packages now require Dart Sass in order to
compile as they now use Sass Modules to improve compilation times.

If you were directly importing from one of these element packages, consider
importing from either `@carbon/styles` or `@carbon/react` instead. Both of these
packages provide entrypoints for elements packages on top of the styles for
Carbon itself.

For teams using these packages directly, you will need to update each of the
elements packages you're using to the latest version.

```bash
npm install @carbon/<package-name>@latest
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn upgrade @carbon/<package-name>@latest
```

Afterwards, you will need to update the import paths and import names themselves
that you bring in. In general, each package now supports importing from the
package directly and all `carbon--` prefixed variables, mixins, and functions
have been renamed to remove the prefix.

For full details fo the changes to each elements package, check out the links
below.

| `@carbon/type`     | [Link](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#carbontype)     |

If you were previously using the `@carbon/import-once` package, you can continue
to use this in v11. However, this package will receive no further updates after
Carbon switched to using Sass Modules.
