## Components

We have deprecated `carbon-components-react` in favor of our new package
`@carbon/react`. All of the component usage and API remains the same. The big
change with this is to avoid having to install three separate packages and
having to keep them in sync.

### What this means for you and your team

Going forward, using our components and styles will be as easy as just
installing or updating one package.

### How to migrate

1. Install the new package

   ```
   npm -i @carbon/react
   ```

   ```
   yarn install @carbon/react
   ```

2. Remove the old packages

   ```
   npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
   ```

   ```
   yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
   ```

3. Update package imports. Migration for this can be as easy as
   find-and-replace. Search for anywhere you're importing components from
   `carbon-components-react` and update the import to point to `@carbon/react`.

## Sass Modules

In v11, our Carbon styles feature two essential changes:

1. Their own dedicated package `@carbon/styles`
2. Transition to Sass modules

Using [Dart-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), we are finally able to use
[the Module System](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched),
dropping the `import-once` helpers that have being causing awful compilation and
build times, and re-thinking how developers bring styles into Carbon.

Here are some reasons why we're moving away from Node-Sass and moving towards
Dart-Sass:

- Import Once: To offer better flexibility for importing Sass files, the project
  used a convention to offer style deduplication due to Sassâ€™s @import behavior.
- Long compile times: While this technique would compile fine using Sass CLIs
  directly, tooling like sass-loader would take an increasingly large amount of
  time.
- Incorrect behavior: In certain configurations with Webpack <4 and sass-loader,
  style duplication was not even being prevented.
- LibSass deprecation: When LibSass was
  [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated), and
  subsequently node-sass, we knew it was time to start looking towards Dart
  Sass.

### What this means for you and your team

- Faster compile times
- Faster build times
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### How to migrate

1. Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
   should be automatic.
2. Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
   dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement.
3. Remove the `carbon-components` dependency and install `@carbon/styles`
4. In any of your files where you are using Carbon sass (tokens, mixins, or
   funcions), you will now need to import the specific sass file at the top. You
   will use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to include the Carbon sass,
   as seen below.

   ```scss
   @use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';

   body {
     background: theme.$background;
   }
   ```

   Alternatively, if you don't want to deal with prefixing all the Carbon sass
   instances, you can do the following:

   ```scss
   @use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme' as *;

   body {
     background: $background;
   }
   ```

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific Carbon sass, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles).

## Color Tokens

We have renamed our color tokens to be more semantic and inform on their usage.
Some of the changes will be easy enough to find-and-replace, however, make sure
to double check that you were using the correct v10 token as to not migrate to
an incorrect token.

### What this means for you and your team

- Intuitive naming ensures correct token usage
- Less ambiguity around what a color token is for

### How to migrate

Check for any sass files that are referencing color tokens, and use our color
token migration table to find the updated token name. We recommend checking
manually since some of the v10 tokens apply to more than one v11 token depending
on usage. For example `hover-ui` could be `field-hover` or `layer-hover`
depending on where it is being used.

To view a full table of v10 color tokens and their v11 equivalent, check out our
[colors migration doc](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/356dcf2c2de54bece89440b989e715f08790d470/docs/migration/11.x-color.md).

## Theming

We have added a new, flexible `Theme` component. The `Theme` component allows
you to specify the theme for a section of the page, for example with inline
theming, or render a theme for an entire page.

### What this means for you and your team

- Inline theming ðŸŽ‰

Here is an example of how you can use the `Theme` component:

```jsx
import { g90 } from '@carbon/themes';

<Theme theme={g90}>
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>;
```

To learn more about how our `Theme` component works with our `useTheme` hook,
checkout our
[Theme docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/carbon-react/src/components/Theme/Theme.mdx).

### Layer Component

In regards to theming, we have also added in a new `Layer` component. The
`Layer` component builds on top of contextual token, allowing you to style
different layers, or directly use the tokens exported from our styles package.

### What this means for you and your team

- More flexibility for 3 layer stacking vs. 2 layer stacking
- Third layer stacking will now be supported in dark themes

Here is an example of how you can use the `Layer` component:

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer>
    <ChildComponent />
    <Layer>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Layer>
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

To learn more about how our `Layer` component works and it's API, checkout our
[Layer docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/carbon-react/src/components/Layer/Layer.mdx).

      <MdxIcon name="github" />
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

## CSS Grid

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid and sub-grid. ðŸŽ‰

Here is a
[link to our Grid docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/11.x-grid.md).

### What this means for you and your team:

- No longer need `Row` components
- You can drop `Column` components directly into `Grid`

  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>

      <MdxIcon name="github" />
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

<!-- 

## Size Props

- Over the years our size props got a little messy. So we updated them, so that
  they are now consistent across all of our components.

### What this means for you and your team:

The props should now look like this:

| Prop Name | Size |
| --------- | ---- |
| xs        | 24px |
| sm        | 32px |
| md        | 40px |
| lg        | 48px |
| xl        | 64px |
| 2xl       | 80px |
