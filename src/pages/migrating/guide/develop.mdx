## Components

### Step 1: Install the new package

```
npm -i @carbon/react
```

or

```
yarn install @carbon/react
```

### Step 2: Remove the old packages

```
npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

or

```
yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

something here about updating imports to point to `@carbon/react` instead of
`carbon-components-react`, maybe explaing that the components all still work the
same just coming from a diff package now. and why did we do this???

## CSS Grid

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid and sub-grid. ðŸŽ‰

Here is a
[link to our Grid docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/11.x-grid.md).

### What this means for you and your team:

- No longer need `Row` components
- You can drop `Column` components directly into `Grid`

## Design Tokens

TODO - to be added

## SASS Modules

Since [NodeSass](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) was
officially deprectated, we thought it might be a good time to transition to
using `Sass modules`.

### What this means for you and your team:

- Faster compile times: reduced by ~90%
- Faster build times: reduced by ~60%
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### This is what updating to Sass modules looks like:

- Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
  should be automatic.
- Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
  dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement. Find more information
  regarding this process
  [here](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate).
- In your project you will now use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to
  include the Carbon packages, as seen below.

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific packages, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles).

```jsx
// Use all styles
@use 'carbon-components';
// Use all styles with configuration
@use 'carbon-components' with (
  $css--reset: false
);
// Include specific modules
@use 'carbon-components/scss/color';
// Include a component
@use 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion';
```

## Size Props

- Over the years our size props got a little messy. So we updated them, so that
  they are now consistent across all of our components.

### What this means for you and your team:

The props should now look like this:

| Prop Name | Size |
| --------- | ---- |
| xs        | 24px |
| sm        | 32px |
| md        | 40px |
| lg        | 48px |
| xl        | 64px |
| 2xl       | 80px |

## Theming

We have added a new, flexible `Theme` component. The `Theme` component allows
you to specify the theme for a section of the page, for example with inline
theming, or render a theme for an entire page.

### What this means for you and your team

- Inline theming ðŸŽ‰

Here is an example of how you can use the `Theme` component:

```jsx
import { g90 } from '@carbon/themes';

<Theme theme={g90}>
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>;
```

To learn more about how our `Theme` component works with our `useTheme` hook,
checkout our
[Theme docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/carbon-react/src/components/Theme/Theme.mdx).

### Layer Component

In regards to theming, we have also added in a new `Layer` component. The
`Layer` component builds on top of contextual token, allowing you to style
different layers, or directly use the tokens exported from our styles package.

### What this means for you and your team

- More flexibility for 3 layer stacking vs. 2 layer stacking
- Third layer stacking will now be supported in dark themes

Here is an example of how you can use the `Layer` component:

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer>
    <ChildComponent />
    <Layer>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Layer>
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

To learn more about how our `Layer` component works and it's API, checkout our
[Layer docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/carbon-react/src/components/Layer/Layer.mdx).
