## Components <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We have deprecated `carbon-components-react`, `carbon-icons` and
`carbon-components` in favor of our new package `@carbon/react`. All of the
component usage and API remains the same. The big change with this is to avoid
having to install three separate packages that you have to keep in sync.

### What this means for you and your team

Going forward, using our components and styles will be as easy as just
installing or updating one package.

### How to migrate

1. Install the new package

```
npm -i @carbon/react
```

```
yarn install @carbon/react
```

2. Remove the old packages

```
npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

```
yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

3. Update package imports. Migration for this can be as easy as
   find-and-replace. Search for anywhere you're importing components or icons
   and update the import to point to `@carbon/react`. Read the next section
   below to find out how to migrate styles.

```js
import { Button } from '@carbon/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Example usage</Button>;
}
```

```js
import { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Add />;
}
```

## Styles <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

In v11, our Carbon styles feature two essential changes: their own dedicated
package, `@carbon/styles`, and transitioning to Sass modules. If you're using
our React components we have some great news for you, you don't have to install
the styles package! `@carbon/react` already forwards all the sass included in
`@carbon/styles`. If you are a library not using our React components, and just
consuming our styles, then your migration will require installing the new
package in addition to what's listed below.

Using [Dart-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), we are finally able to use
[the Module System](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched),
dropping the `import-once` helpers that have being causing awful compilation and
build times, and re-thinking how developers bring styles into Carbon.

Here are some reasons why we're moving away from Node-Sass and moving towards
Dart-Sass:

- Import Once: To offer better flexibility for importing Sass files, the project
  used a convention to offer style deduplication due to Sassâ€™s @import behavior.
- Long compile times: While this technique would compile fine using Sass CLIs
  directly, tooling like sass-loader would take an increasingly large amount of
  time.
- Incorrect behavior: In certain configurations with Webpack <4 and sass-loader,
  style duplication was not even being prevented.
- LibSass deprecation: When LibSass was
  [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated), and
  subsequently node-sass, we knew it was time to start looking towards Dart
  Sass.

### What this means for you and your team

- Faster compile times
- Faster build times
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### How to migrate

1. Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
   should be automatic.
2. Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
   dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement.
3. In any of your files where you are using Carbon sass (tokens, mixins, or
   funcions), you will now need to import the specific sass file at the top. You
   will use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to include the Carbon sass,
   as seen below. If you're using our React components, your import will point
   to the `@carbon/react` package. If you're a library just using the styles
   package, your import will point to that.

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme';

body {
  background: theme.$background;
}
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to deal with prefixing all the Carbon sass
instances, you can do the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;

body {
  background: $background;
}
```

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific Carbon sass, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles).

## Color Tokens <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We have renamed our color tokens to be more semantic and better inform on their
usage. Some of the changes can be easily done with find-and-replace, however,
some may require more manual updates. When migrating, make sure to double check
that you were using the correct v10 token as to not migrate to an incorrect
token.

### What this means for you and your team

- Intuitive naming ensures correct token usage
- Less ambiguity around what a color token is for

### How to migrate

1. Check for any sass files that are referencing color tokens, and use our color
   token migration table to find the updated token name. We recommend checking
   manually since some of the v10 tokens apply to more than one v11 token,
   depending on its usage. For example, `hover-ui` could be `field-hover` or
   `layer-hover`.

To view a full table of v10 color tokens and their v11 equivalent, check out our
[colors migration doc](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/11.x-color.md).

</Row>

## CSS Grid <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid. ðŸŽ‰ Previously, our grid used CSS Flexbox, which made
it hard to support nesting grids. At the moment, we are not providing an option
to continue using flexbox grid in v11. Another notable change is that, by
default, our grid is now 16 columns and there is no continued support for 12
columns.

### What this means for you and your team:

- 16 column grid only
- Support for nested grids

### How to migrate

`Grid` and `Column` continue to have the same props, but operate just a little
bit differently. We realize the strategy for updating the grid might change from
team to team, so instead we're just going to highlight some of the big changes
you need to keep in mind when tackling this transition.

- If you are using a 3 column layout anywhere, we suggest talking to your design
  team to decide on an alternate layout since we are no longer supporting 12
  columns. We realize this may be frustrating, but we hope the other cool
  features we now support make it worth the change!
- Use `Grid` component for subgrids.
- `Row` component is deprecated. You can drop `Column` components directly into
  `Grid`, including nested grids.
- All columns by default will span just one column, not span the full width like
  flex columns. You _must_ be explicit about how many columns you want to span
  for each breakpoint. Below, you can find what a full width 4 column layout
  would've looked like in v10 and what it looks like now in v11.
- To view more detailed examples of our v11 grid, checkout our grid [story](#).
<!-- to-do: add grid storybook link once it's live -->

Some usage guidelines to keep in mind when migrating are:

- Wide grid should always be the parent grid
- Some grids, like condensed grid, don't exist in isolation; they are always
  mixed.

#### v10 auto columns

```jsx
<Grid>
  <Row>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
  </Row>
</Grid>
```

#### v11 auto columns

```jsx
<Grid>
  // first row - 4 col full span like the v10 auto columns
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  // second row - v11 auto columns
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
</Grid>
```

#### Nested grid

```jsx
<Grid>
  <Column sm={2} md={4} lg={3}>
    <p>Small: Span 2 of 4</p>
    <p>Medium: Span 4 of 8</p>
    <p>Large: Span 3 of 16</p>
  </Column>
  <Column sm={2} md={4} lg={10}>
    <p>Small: Span 2 of 4</p>
    <p>Medium: Span 4 of 8</p>
    <p>Large: Span 10 of 16</p>
    <Grid>
      <Column sm={1} md={1} lg={2}>
        <p>sm={1}</p> <p>md={1}</p> <p>lg={2}</p>
      </Column>
      <Column sm={1} md={1} lg={2}>
        <p>sm={1}</p> <p>md={1}</p> <p>lg={2}</p>
      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={1} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={1}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>

      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={0}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>
      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={0}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>
      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={0}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>
      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={0}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>
      </Column>
    </Grid>
  </Column>
  <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={3}>
    <p>Small: Span 0 of 4</p>
    <p>Medium: Span 0 of 8</p>
    <p>Large: Span 3 of 16</p>
  </Column>
</Grid>
```

## Theming

With our theming updates we have some new features and some breaking changes.
You can now specify you're theme with our new
[Theme component](#theme-component)., and incorporate inline theming. You can
also specify a layer with a [Layer component](#layer-component).

### Layer Component <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

In regards to theming, we have also added in a new `Layer` component. The
`Layer` component replaces the `light` prop. It is a container that renders the
`cds--layer` class name. The class name then remaps contextual tokens to the
next layer. This allows you to style different layers, or directly use the
tokens exported from our styles package.

### What this means for you and your team

- Layer componet replaces `light` prop. See the first example below.
- More flexibility for 3 layer stacking vs. 2 layer stacking
- Third layer stacking will now be supported in dark themes

```jsx
  // v10
  <Dropdown light />

  // v11
  <Layer>
    <Dropdown />
  </Layer>
```

Here is an example of how you can use the `Layer` component:

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer>
    <ChildComponent />
    <Layer>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Layer>
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

To learn more about how our `Layer` component works and it's API, checkout out
the resource link below.

### Theme Component <Tag type="green">New</Tag>

We have added a new, flexible `Theme` component. The `Theme` component allows
you to specify the theme for a section of the page, for example with inline
theming, or render a theme for an entire page.

### What this means for you and your team

- Inline theming ðŸŽ‰

Here is an example of how you can use the `Theme` component:

```jsx
import { g90 } from '@carbon/themes';

<Theme theme={g90}>
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>;
```

To learn more about how our `Theme` component works with our `useTheme` hook,
checkout our resource link below.

## Size Props

- Over the years our size props got a little messy. So we updated them, so that
  they are now consistent across all of our components.

### What this means for you and your team:

The props should now look like this:

| Prop Name | Size |
| --------- | ---- |
| xs        | 24px |
| sm        | 32px |
| md        | 40px |
| lg        | 48px |
| xl        | 64px |
| 2xl       | 80px |
