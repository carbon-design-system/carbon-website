## Components <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We have deprecated `carbon-components-react`, `carbon-icons` and
`carbon-components` in favor of our new package `@carbon/react`. All of the
component usage and API remains the same. The big change with this is to avoid
having to install three separate packages that you have to keep in sync.

### What this means for you and your team

Going forward, using our components and styles will be as easy as just
installing or updating one package.

### How to migrate

1. Install the new package

```
npm i @carbon/react
```

```
yarn add @carbon/react
```

2. Remove the old packages

```
npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

```
yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

3. Update package imports. Migration for this can be as easy as
   find-and-replace. Search for anywhere you're importing components or icons
   and update the import to point to `@carbon/react`. Read the next section
   below to find out how to migrate styles.

```js
import { Button } from '@carbon/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Example usage</Button>;
}
```

```js
import { Add16 } from '@carbon/react/icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Add16 />;
}
```

## Styles <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

In v11, our Carbon styles feature two essential changes: their own dedicated
package, `@carbon/styles`, and transitioning to Sass modules. If you're using
our React components we have some great news for you, you don't have to install
the styles package! `@carbon/react` already forwards all the sass included in
`@carbon/styles`. If you are a library not using our React components, and just
consuming our styles, then your migration will require installing the new
package in addition to what's listed below.

Using [Dart-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), we are finally able to use
[the Module System](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched),
dropping the `import-once` helpers that have being causing awful compilation and
build times, and re-thinking how developers bring styles into Carbon.

Here are some reasons why we're moving away from Node-Sass and moving towards
Dart-Sass:

- Import Once: To offer better flexibility for importing Sass files, the project
  used a convention to offer style deduplication due to Sassâ€™s @import behavior.
- Long compile times: While this technique would compile fine using Sass CLIs
  directly, tooling like sass-loader would take an increasingly large amount of
  time.
- Incorrect behavior: In certain configurations with Webpack <4 and sass-loader,
  style duplication was not even being prevented.
- LibSass deprecation: When LibSass was
  [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated), and
  subsequently node-sass, we knew it was time to start looking towards Dart
  Sass.

### What this means for you and your team

- Faster compile times
- Faster build times
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### How to migrate

1. Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
   should be automatic.
2. Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
   dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement.
3. In any of your files where you are using Carbon sass (tokens, mixins, or
   funcions), you will now need to import the specific sass file at the top. You
   will use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to include the Carbon sass,
   as seen below. If you're using our React components, your import will point
   to the `@carbon/react` package. If you're a library just using the styles
   package, your import will point to that.

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme';

body {
  background: theme.$background;
}
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to deal with prefixing all the Carbon sass
instances, you can do the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;

body {
  background: $background;
}
```

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific Carbon sass, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles)
or read about it from a developer's perspective in this
[Medium article](https://medium.com/carbondesign/migrating-from-node-sass-to-sass-eba9db004a3a).

## Color Tokens <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We have renamed our color tokens to be more semantic and better inform on their
usage. Some of the changes can be easily done with find-and-replace, however,
some may require more manual updates. When migrating, make sure to double check
that you were using the correct v10 token as to not migrate to an incorrect
token.

### What this means for you and your team

- Intuitive naming ensures correct token usage
- Less ambiguity around what a color token is for

### How to migrate

1. Check for any sass files that are referencing color tokens, and use our color
   token migration table to find the updated token name. We recommend checking
   manually since some of the v10 tokens apply to more than one v11 token,
   depending on its usage. For example, `hover-ui` could be `field-hover` or
   `layer-hover`.

To view a full table of v10 color tokens and their v11 equivalent, check out our
[colors migration doc](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/11.x-color.md).

## CSS Grid <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid. ðŸŽ‰ Previously, our grid used CSS Flexbox, which made
it hard to support nesting grids. At the moment, we are not providing an option
to continue using flexbox grid in v11. Another notable change is that, by
default, our grid is now 16 columns and there is no continued support for 12
columns.

### What this means for you and your team:

- 16 column grid only
- Support for nested grids

### How to migrate

`Grid` and `Column` continue to have the same props, but operate just a little
bit differently. We realize the strategy for updating the grid might change from
team to team, so instead we're just going to highlight some of the big changes
you need to keep in mind when tackling this transition.

- If you are using a 3 column layout anywhere, we suggest talking to your design
  team to decide on an alternate layout since we are no longer supporting 12
  columns. We realize this may be frustrating, but we hope the other cool
  features we now support make it worth the change!
- Use `Grid` component for subgrids.
- `Row` component is deprecated. You can drop `Column` components directly into
  `Grid`, including nested grids.
- All columns by default will span just one column, not span the full width like
  flex columns. You _must_ be explicit about how many columns you want to span
  for each breakpoint. Below, you can find what a full width 4 column layout
  would've looked like in v10 and what it looks like now in v11.
- To view more detailed examples of our v11 grid, checkout our grid [story](#).
<!-- to-do: add grid storybook link once it's live -->

Some usage guidelines to keep in mind when migrating are:

- Wide grid should always be the parent grid
- Some grids, like condensed grid, don't exist in isolation; they are always
  mixed.

#### v10 auto columns

```jsx
<Grid>
  <Row>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
    <Column>1 of 4</Column>
  </Row>
</Grid>
```

#### v11 auto columns

```jsx
<Grid>
  // first row - 4 col full span like the v10 auto columns
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  <Column lg={4}>1 of 4</Column>
  // second row - v11 auto columns
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
  <Column>1 of 8</Column>
</Grid>
```

#### Nested grid

```jsx
<Grid>
  <Column sm={2} md={4} lg={3}>
    <p>Small: Span 2 of 4</p>
    <p>Medium: Span 4 of 8</p>
    <p>Large: Span 3 of 16</p>
  </Column>
  <Column sm={2} md={4} lg={10}>
    <p>Small: Span 2 of 4</p>
    <p>Medium: Span 4 of 8</p>
    <p>Large: Span 10 of 16</p>
    <Grid>

      </Column>
      <Column sm={0} md={0} lg={1}>
        <p>sm={0}</p> <p>md={0}</p> <p>lg={1}</p>

## Theming

With our theming updates we have some new features and some breaking changes.
You can now specify you're theme with our new
[Theme component](#theme-component)., and incorporate inline theming. You can
also specify a layer with a [Layer component](#layer-component).

### Layer Component <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

In regards to theming, we have also added in a new `Layer` component. The
`Layer` component replaces the `light` prop. It is a container that renders the
`cds--layer` class name. The class name then remaps contextual tokens to the
next layer. This allows you to style different layers, or directly use the
tokens exported from our styles package.

#### What this means for you and your team

- Layer componet replaces `light` prop. See the first example below.
- More flexibility for 3 layer stacking vs. 2 layer stacking
- Third layer stacking will now be supported in dark themes

```jsx
  // v10
  <Dropdown light />

  // v11
  <Layer>
    <Dropdown />
  </Layer>
```

Here is an example of how you can use the `Layer` component:

```jsx
<Layer>
  <ChildComponent />
  <Layer>
    <ChildComponent />
    <Layer>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Layer>
  </Layer>
</Layer>
```

To learn more about how our `Layer` component works and it's API, checkout out
the resource link below.

### Theme Component <Tag type="green">New</Tag>

We have added a new, flexible `Theme` component. The `Theme` component allows
you to specify the theme for a section of the page, for example with inline
theming, or render a theme for an entire page.

#### What this means for you and your team

- Inline theming ðŸŽ‰

Here is an example of how you can use the `Theme` component:

```jsx
<Theme theme="g90">
  <ChildComponent />
</Theme>
```

To learn more about how our `Theme` component works with our `useTheme` hook,
checkout our
[usage docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/carbon-react/src/components/Theme/Theme.mdx).
You can also checkout a
[live example](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial/blob/v11-react-step-5/src/App.js)
of the Carbon Tutorial to see theming in action.

## Updates to `@carbon/icons-react`

We have two new changes to our `@carbon/icons-react` package. We have updated
the default prop size and the way it can be imported.

### Icon size prop

We are updating the default size prop for all icons to `md`.

### Importing

All icons can now be imported from `@carbon/react/icons`. In v11, you'll still
be able to access `@carbon/icons-react`, however it is available directly from
the `@carbon/react` package, by default.

Here is an example of how to import an icon:

```js
import { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';
```

## Component API

### Size prop updates <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We updated all our components with size variants to have the same API.
Previously, the size options were inconsistent: `field`, `medium`, `short`.
Sizing options will now be the same across all components for less confusion.

#### What this means for you and your team

- You will always know what to expect from components to size correctly

#### How to migrate

The following components all have size variants that may be affected in your
code:

- Accordion
- Button
- ComboBox
- Dropdown
- Multiselect
- Filterable multiselect
- ContentSwitcher
- DataTable
- DatePicker
- FileUploader
- FileUploaderItem
- FileUploaderDropContainer
- FileUploaderButton
- Link
- Modal
- ComposedModal
- NumberInput
- OverflowMenu
- Search
- Select
- Tag
- TextInput
- TimePicker
- Toggle

If you are using any size variants of those listed components, use the following
table to determine what updated value to use for the size prop. The default size
in v11 is `md` (`40px`).

| Prop value | Size |
| ---------- | ---- |
| `xs`       | 24px |
| `sm`       | 32px |
| `md`       | 40px |
| `lg`       | 48px |
| `xl`       | 64px |
| `2xl`      | 80px |

### ClassName prop updates <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We updated our components to pass custom `className` to the outermost element of
a component's inner markup. A lot of components already placed this prop on the
outermost layer, but many were targetting elements inside the wrappers.

#### What this means for you and your team

- Easily target any component HTML element since the `className` is now added to
  the wrapper

#### How to migrate

The following components previously were not applying the `className` prop to
the outermost element. If you were using a custom `className` to target an inner
element for any of these components, you will have to update your selectors to
now account for the `className` being in the wrapper.

- Checkbox
- Combobox
- Table
- TableToolbar
- DataTableSkeleton
- DatePicker
- DatePickerSkeleton
- DatePickerInput
- Dropdown
- FileUploaderDropContainer
- FileUploaderItem
- FormGroup
- FilterableMultiSelect
- MultiSelect
- NotificationTextDetails
- NotificationIcon
- NumberInput
- OverflowMenuItem
- RadioButtonGroup
- RadioTile
- Select
- Slider
- Switch
- TextArea
- ControlledPasswordInput
- PasswordInput
- TextInput
- TimePicker
- Tooltip
- HeaderContainer

### Event handler updates <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

Guidance coming soon.

## New Components

We are releasing a few new components that complement our accessibility
initiatives and component changes.

### Popover

This component primitive is most similar a tile or card. However, Popover is a
primitive consumed by other components to render content. Popover components can
also be referred to as Disclosures, and will be accomodate a lot of the changes
being made in our Tooltip component.

Learn more about our Popover component and it's API below:

<Row className="resource-card-group">
  <Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>
    <ResourceCard
      subTitle="Popover"
      href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/Popover"
    >
      <MdxIcon name="github" />
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

## Notifications <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

We have updated the notification components to be more accessible out of the
box. `ToastNotification` and `InlineNotification` now have `role="status"` by
default with additional `role` options of `log` and `alert`. These components do
not receive focus and should be used for information-only use cases. These
components no longer accept actions or interactive children.

For notifications requiring an action, a new `ActionableNotifiation` component
is available. It has a `role="alertdialog"` and recieves focus by default.
Automatic placement of focus can be turned off via the new `hasFocus` prop.

All notifications have a new optional `closeOnEscape` prop, it enables
notifications to closed by pressing the `escape` key. For more details, see the
[notification components accessibility page](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/accessibility).

### What this means for you and your team

- Notifications will be WAI-ARIA compliant out of the box without the explicit
  need for additional functionality or configuration

### How to migrate

#### Update `ToastNotification` usage

- The `title`, `subtitle` and `caption` props have been removed. Compose
  notification contents using `children` instead.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements. A `ToastNotification`
  containing an action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification`.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

#### Update `InlineNotification` usage

- The `title`, `subtitle` props have been removed. Compose notification contents
  using `children` instead.
- The `actions` prop has been removed. An `InlineNotification` containing an
  action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification` configured with the `inline` prop.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

#### When using `ActionableNotification`:

- The `inline` prop enables a styling variation resulting in a similar visual
  design to `InlineNotification`.
- The `actionButtonLabel` prop configures the action button text.
- The `hasFocus` prop toggles the automatic placement of focus.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

## Tabs <Tag type="cyan">Breaking</Tag>

Tabs got a big revamp in v11! Tabs are now more composable than ever before,
meaning that you have the flexibity and control on your end to make them look
and act how you want.

### How to migrate

Example of Tabs in v10:

```js
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tab label 1">
    <p>Content for first tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 2">
    <p>Content for second tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 3" disabled>
    <p>Content for third tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab
    label="Tab label 4 shows truncation"
    title="Tab label 4 shows truncation"
  >
    <p>Content for fourth tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Those same Tabs, migrated to v11:

```js
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Tab Label 1</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab Label 2</Tab>
    <Tab disabled>Tab Label 3</Tab>
    <Tab title="Tab Label 4 shows truncation">Tab Label 4 shows truncation</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Content for first tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for second tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for third tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for fourth tab goes here.</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Update `Tabs` and `Tab` usage

All the same functionality for Tabs is available in v11 and more! However, some
props have been deprecated becuase they have either been renamed or are no
longer needed. Below are the minor tweaks in naming or implementation.

- the `type` prop is deprecated. Both "container" and "default" tabs still exist
  but now can be called by adding the prop `contained` to the `TabList`.
- Default tabs are now referred to as line tabs in our documentation here and in
  our storybook.
- `hidden` prop is no longer needed with the new composable Tabs. You have
  control over tab content and when it is hidden through the `TabPanel` and
  `TabPanels` components.
- `selected` prop is now named `selectedIndex`.
- `tabContentClassName` is no longer needed. `TabPanel` (equivalent to tab
  content) takes in a className prop on its outermost node.
- For `Tab`, `label` is no longer needed. `children` of `Tab` are now the label.
- Due to its composability, `renderAnchor`, `renderButton`, `renderContent` are
  no longer needed on `Tab`. You now have full control over what is rendered
  inside of `Tab` and `TabPanel`.
- Because `renderButton` is no longer needed, the associated `tabIndex` prop has
  also been deprecated.
- `selected` on `Tab` is deprecated in favor or `selectedIndex`, now placed on
  `Tabs` instead.

For more details about the changes to Tabs, see our storybook documentation
[here](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tabs--default).
