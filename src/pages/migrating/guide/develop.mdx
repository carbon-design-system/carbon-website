## Overview

This guide helps you update your project to Carbon v11. It is broken into
sections based on packages that you are using in your project today. For most
teams using Carbon, you'll want to use the
[`carbon-components-react`](#carbon-components-react) section.

One of the biggest changes coming to Carbon in v11 is that we are moving to
dedicated packages under the `@carbon` scope. What this means for you is that if
you were previously using the following packages:

- `carbon-components`
- `carbon-components-react`
- `carbon-icons`
- `@carbon/icons-react`

You can access all of this work under one single package: `@carbon/react`. This
package will re-export all of the styles and icons for Carbon all in one
dependency.

If you were previously using `carbon-components`, the styles from this package
are available under `@carbon/styles`. They are also re-exported through
`@carbon/react`

Both the `carbon-components` and `carbon-components-react` packages will stick
around in v11 but they will only be re-exports of `@carbon/styles` and
`@carbon/react` respectively.

<InlineNotification>
  Some of the migration steps below can be automated using the `@carbon/upgrade`
  CLI. For full details, see the [`@carbon/upgrade` package
  documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/upgrade)
</InlineNotification>

## carbon-components-react

Starting in v11, the React components for Carbon live in the `@carbon/react`
package.

The `@carbon/react` package also includes the styles for Carbon along with
icons.

### Step 1: Install @carbon/react

To get started, uninstall the following packages if they exist in your project:

- `carbon-components`
- `carbon-components-react`
- `carbon-icons`
- `@carbon/icons-react`

```bash
npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons @carbon/icons-react
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons @carbon/icons-react
```

Next, install the `@carbon/react` package:

```bash
npm install @carbon/react
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add @carbon/react
```

### Step 2: Styles and Dart Sass

If you're importing styles from `carbon-components`, you can now import styles
directly from `@carbon/react` or the `@carbon/react/scss` folder.

Before you're able to bring in these styles, you'll need to make sure your
project is setup to use Dart Sass. Starting in v11, Carbon styles requires Dart
Sass through the `sass` package in order to compile. This change comes from our
migration to Sass Modules in order to improve our compilation times and overall
project structure.

If you don't have this dependency already in your project, you can install it:

```bash
npm install sass
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add sass
```

Similarly, if you currently use `node-sass` now is a good time to remove that
dependency from your project. In most situations, Dart Sass is a drop-in
replacement for `node-sass` and should require no changes on your end in order
to use it once you install the dependency.

### Step 3: Setup Dart Sass for your project

Once you have Dart Sass installed, it's important that you configure your
project to support resolving imports in Sass from `node_modules`. Typically,
this means adding `node_modules` to your `includePaths` config for Sass in your
bundler or toolchain of choice.

To learn more about how to configure your specific toolchain to support this,
read the documentation for configuration
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/styles/docs/sass.md#configuration).
We also have published a guide over on
[Medium](https://medium.com/carbondesign/migrating-from-node-sass-to-sass-eba9db004a3a)
to help out with common problems that come from this migration.

### Step 4: Update style import paths

In v10, you may have been bringing in styles from `carbon-components` by either
importing the styles directly with:

```scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

Or, you imported the styles through specific entrypoints:

```scss
// Feature flags
$feature-flags: (
  enable-columns-16: true,
);
// Options
$css--default-type: true;
$css--reset: true;
// Top-level imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vars';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/colors';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/theme';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/spacing';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--reset';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--body';
// Component imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion/accordion';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/button/button';
```

If you imported the entrypoint from `carbon-components`, you can now do this
directly from `@carbon/styles` without any additional paths by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/react';
```

If you were providing any configuration options before you imported Carbon you
can now provide them using the `with` syntax:

```scss
@use '@carbon/react' with ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
```

If you were using any feature flags in v10, you can safely remove them in v11.

**Note:** you can also use `@import` to bring in Carbon, if you prefer, although
`@use` is recommended.

If you were bringing parts of Carbon, you'll need to update the paths to reflect
the new paths in `@carbon/styles`. In general, most paths moved from
`scss/globals/scss/filename` to `scss/filename`.

```scss
// Configuration
@use '@carbon/react/scss/config' with
  ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
// Reset
@use '@carbon/react/scss/reset';
// Grid
@use '@carbon/react/scss/grid';
// Helpers
@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/type';
// Components
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/accordion';
@use '@carbon/react/scss/components/button';
```

For a full list of the paths that have changed in `carbon-components`, check out
our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss).

**Note:** if you see any references to `@carbon/styles` for style imports, you
can safely replace the beginning of the path with `@carbon/react` for the same
import in this package.

### Step 5: Update Sass imports

If you're project is currently importing from different parts of
`carbon-components` for specific variables, mixins, or functions then you will
need to make sure that your imports have been updated to the correct path.

The full list of changes are available in our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss)
but, in general, most imports have been updates so that the `carbon--` is no
longer necessary.

### Step 6: Update JavaScript imports

<InlineNotification>
  This step can be automated using the `@carbon/upgrade` CLI. For full details,
  see the `@carbon/upgrade` [package
  documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/upgrade)
</InlineNotification>

After updating how you bring in styles, you will need to update your import
paths from `carbon-components-react` to `@carbon/react` for components that
you're bringing from Carbon.

```jsx
// Before
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'carbon-components-react';
// After
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from '@carbon/react';
```

### Step 7: Update icon imports

<InlineNotification>
  This step can be automated using the `@carbon/upgrade` CLI. For full details,
  see the `@carbon/upgrade` [package
  documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/upgrade)
</InlineNotification>

The `@carbon/icons-react` package has been updated to minimize the number of
exports from the package to help reduce build and compile times. This package is
available under `@carbon/react/icons`.

This update includes a change to the API of the icon components that come from
this package. Previously, we would export icons that included the size of the
asset. This update allows you to bring the icon directly and specify the size
using the `size` prop.

**Before**

```jsx
import { Add32, Add24, Add20, Add16 } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add32 />
      <Add24 />
      <Add20 />
      <Add16 />
    </>
  );
}
```

**After**

```jsx
import { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add size={32} />
      <Add size={24} />
      <Add size={20} />
      <Add />
    </>
  );
}
```

With this change, you can now import icons from `@carbon/react` directly by
writing:

```jsx
import { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';
```

### Step 8: Update components that have changed

In v11, we have updated the APIs of certain components in one of the following
ways:

- Update `className` usage to be applied to the outermost element of a component
- Update `size` to have consistent values across the codebase
- Remove props that have been deprecated in v10
- Refactor the API to ship an accessible component

For a full list of changes to components, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#carbon-components-react).
Below are some common changes that may impact you and your usage of Carbon.

#### Changes to `className`

The usage of `className` prop has been updated so that the class is passed to
the outermost element of a component's inner markup. This was already the case
for most components and this change brings along the remaining components in the
library to this convention.

The following components previously were not applying the `className` prop to
the outermost element. If you were using a custom `className` to target an inner
element for any of these components, you will have to update your selectors to
now account for the `className` being placed on the outermost element.

- Checkbox
- ComboBox
- Table
- TableToolbar
- DataTableSkeleton
- DatePicker
- DatePickerSkeleton
- DatePickerInput
- Dropdown
- FileUploaderDropContainer
- FileUploaderItem
- FormGroup
- FilterableMultiSelect
- MultiSelect
- NotificationTextDetails
- NotificationIcon
- NumberInput
- OverflowMenuItem
- RadioButtonGroup
- RadioTile
- Select
- Slider
- Switch
- TextArea
- ControlledPasswordInput
- PasswordInput
- TextInput
- TimePicker
- Tooltip
- HeaderContainer

#### Changes to `size`

Components with size variants have been updated to use the same API options.
Previously, the size options were inconsistent: `field`, `medium`, `short`. Now,
size options fall under the following values:

| Prop value | Size |
| ---------- | ---- |
| `xs`       | 24px |
| `sm`       | 32px |
| `md`       | 40px |
| `lg`       | 48px |
| `xl`       | 64px |
| `2xl`      | 80px |

**Note:** the default size in v11 is `md` (`40px`).

The following components all have size variants that may be affected in your
code. To update, you will need to switch to one of the size options above.

- Accordion
- Button
- ComboBox
- Dropdown
- Multiselect
- Filterable multiselect
- ContentSwitcher
- DataTable
- DatePicker
- FileUploader
- FileUploaderItem
- FileUploaderDropContainer
- FileUploaderButton
- Link
- Modal
- ComposedModal
- NumberInput
- OverflowMenu
- Search
- Select
- Tag
- TextInput
- TimePicker
- Toggle

#### Notification

We have updated the notification components to be more accessible out of the
box. `ToastNotification` and `InlineNotification` now have `role="status"` by
default with additional `role` options of `log` and `alert`. These components do
not receive focus and should be used for information-only use cases. These
components no longer accept actions or interactive children.

For notifications requiring an action, a new `ActionableNotifiation` component
is available. It has a `role="alertdialog"` and recieves focus by default.
Automatic placement of focus can be turned off via the new `hasFocus` prop.

All notifications have a new optional `closeOnEscape` prop, it enables
notifications to closed by pressing the `escape` key. For more details, see the
[notification components accessibility page](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/accessibility).

#### Update `ToastNotification` usage

- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements. A `ToastNotification`
  containing an action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification`.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

#### Update `InlineNotification` usage

- The `actions` prop has been removed. An `InlineNotification` containing an
  action or interactive children should be replaced with
  `ActionableNotification` configured with the `inline` prop.
- `children` can no longer contain interactive elements.
- The `notificationType` prop is no longer needed and can be removed.
- The default `role` is now `status`. `log` and `alert` can also be used.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

#### When using `ActionableNotification`:

- The `inline` prop enables a styling variation resulting in a similar visual
  design to `InlineNotification`.
- The `actionButtonLabel` prop configures the action button text.
- The `hasFocus` prop toggles the automatic placement of focus.
- The `closeOnEscape` prop toggles the closing of notifications via the `escape`
  key.

#### Tabs

Tabs have been updated to be more composable so that you have the flexibity and
control to make them look and act how you want.

In v10, you may have code that looks like the following:

```js
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tab label 1">
    <p>Content for first tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 2">
    <p>Content for second tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab label 3" disabled>
    <p>Content for third tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab
    label="Tab label 4 shows truncation"
    title="Tab label 4 shows truncation"
  >
    <p>Content for fourth tab goes here.</p>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Those same Tabs, migrated to v11:

```js
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Tab Label 1</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab Label 2</Tab>
    <Tab disabled>Tab Label 3</Tab>
    <Tab title="Tab Label 4 shows truncation">Tab Label 4 shows truncation</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Content for first tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for second tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for third tab goes here.</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content for fourth tab goes here.</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

#### Update `Tabs` and `Tab` usage

All the same functionality for Tabs is available in v11 and more! However, some
props have been deprecated becuase they have either been renamed or are no
longer needed. Below are the minor tweaks in naming or implementation.

- the `type` prop is deprecated. Both "container" and "default" tabs still exist
  but now can be called by adding the prop `contained` to the `TabList`.
- Default tabs are now referred to as line tabs in our documentation here and in
  our storybook.
- `hidden` prop is no longer needed with the new composable Tabs. You have
  control over tab content and when it is hidden through the `TabPanel` and
  `TabPanels` components.
- `selected` prop is now named `selectedIndex`.
- `tabContentClassName` is no longer needed. `TabPanel` (equivalent to tab
  content) takes in a className prop on its outermost node.
- For `Tab`, `label` is no longer needed. `children` of `Tab` are now the label.
- Due to its composability, `renderAnchor`, `renderButton`, `renderContent` are
  no longer needed on `Tab`. You now have full control over what is rendered
  inside of `Tab` and `TabPanel`.
- Because `renderButton` is no longer needed, the associated `tabIndex` prop has
  also been deprecated.
- `selected` on `Tab` is deprecated in favor or `selectedIndex`, now placed on
  `Tabs` instead.

For more details about the changes to Tabs, see our storybook documentation
[here](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tabs--default).

### Step 9: Done with @carbon/react!

And that's it! You're done. At this point you have migrated to use Carbon v11
using the `@carbon/react` package.

If you run into any problems after this point, please feel free to reach out to
us over on Slack or open up a discussion on
[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions/categories/help).
We want to make this migration experience as seamless as possible and will be
monitoring both areas to help out.

## carbon-components

Starting in v11, the styles for Carbon live in the `@carbon/styles` package.
Alternatively, you can continue to use `carbon-components` as it re-exports
styles from this package directly.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using carbon-components-react, you can bring in styles directly from
the new package @carbon/react. To learn more, visit the
[carbon-components-react](#carbon-components-react) section.

</InlineNotification>

### Step 1: Install @carbon/styles

To get started, uninstall `carbon-components` from your project:

```bash
npm uninstall carbon-components
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn remove carbon-components
```

Next, install the `@carbon/styles` package:

```bash
npm install @carbon/styles
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add @carbon/styles
```

### Step 2: Install Dart Sass

Previously, `carbon-components` supported being compiled by different Sass
libraries. Starting in v11, the `@carbon/styles` package requires Dart Sass
through the `sass` package in order to compile. This change comes from our
migration to Sass Modules in order to improve our compilation times and overall
project structure.

If you don't have this dependency already in your project, you can install it:

```bash
npm install sass
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add sass
```

Similarly, if you currently use `node-sass` now is a good time to remove that
dependency from your project. In most situations, Dart Sass is a drop-in
replacement for `node-sass` and should require no changes on your end in order
to use it once you install the dependency.

### Step 3: Setup Dart Sass

One you have Dart Sass installed, it's important that you configure your project
to support resolving imports in Sass from `node_modules`. Typically, this means
adding `node_modules` to your `includePaths` config for Sass in your bundler or
toolchain of choice.

To learn more about how to configure your specific toolchain to support this,
read the documentation for configuration
[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/styles/docs/sass.md#configuration).
We also have published a guide over on
[Medium](https://medium.com/carbondesign/migrating-from-node-sass-to-sass-eba9db004a3a)
to help out with common problems that come from this migration.

### Step 4: Update import paths

In v10, you may have been bringing in styles from `carbon-components` by either
importing the styles directly with:

```scss
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

Or, you imported the styles through specific entrypoints:

```scss
// Feature flags
$feature-flags: (
  enable-columns-16: true,
);
// Options
$css--default-type: true;
$css--reset: true;
// Top-level imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/vars';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/colors';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/theme';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/spacing';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/typography';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--reset';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/css--body';
// Component imports
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion/accordion';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/button/button';
```

If you imported the entrypoint from `carbon-components`, you can now do this
directly from `@carbon/styles` without any additional paths by writing:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles';
```

If you were providing any configuration options before you imported Carbon you
can now provide them using the `with` syntax:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles' with ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
```

If you were using any feature flags in v10, you can safely remove them in v11.

**Note:** you can also use `@import` to bring in Carbon, if you prefer, although
`@use` is recommended.

If you were bringing parts of Carbon, you'll need to update the paths to reflect
the new paths in `@carbon/styles`. In general, most paths moved from
`scss/globals/scss/filename` to `scss/filename`.

```scss
// Configuration
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with
  ($css--default-type: true, $css--reset: true);
// Reset
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/reset';
// Grid
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid';
// Helpers
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/theme';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/spacing';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/type';
// Components
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/accordion';
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/components/button';
```

For a full list of the paths that have changed in `carbon-components`, check out
our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss).

### Step 5: Update imports

If you were using specific variables, mixins, or functions from Carbon, it may
be that you will need to update their name in v11. In general, all `carbon--`
prefixed names have been renamed to drop the `carbon--` prefix.

For a full list of the changes to variables, mixins, and functions that have
changed, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss)
and find the specific file that you were importing from.

For a full list of the paths that have changed in `carbon-components`, check out
our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#changing-import-paths-from-scssglobalsscss-to-scss).

### Step 6: Update bx to cds

If you are targeting specific selectors that use the `bx` prefix, you will need
to update your code to either target the `cds` prefix for selectors or update
Carbon's configuration to use `bx` as the prefix by writing the following:

```scss
// Option A
@use '@carbon/styles' with ($prefix: 'bx');
// Option B
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/config' with ($prefix: 'bx');
```

### Step 7: Enable flexbox grid

If you are using the flexbox-based grid in your project, you can continue to use
this feature in v11 by importing the following:

```scss
@use '@carbon/styles/scss/grid/flexbox';
```

This is important due to the fact that the CSS Grid implementation is used by
default in v11. However, bringing in the flexbox grid styles in this way means
that your layouts will continue to work the same as in v10.

### Step 8: Update color tokens

If you are using color tokens from Carbon, you can either update to use the new
tokens in v11 or use the compatability theme for incremental adoption of the new
tokens while maintaining existing work from v10.

For an overview of the changes to tokens, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#design-tokens).

If you would like to use the compatability theme, you can write the following in
your project where you are currently bringing in theme:

```scss
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/compat/themes' as compat;
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';
@use '@carbon/themes/scss/theme' with
  ($fallback: compat.$g100, $theme: themes.$g100);
```

Doing this will allow you to use tokens from the g100 theme in v10 along with
the tokens in v11. This will work for any of the themes in v10 including white,
g10, g90, and g100.

### Step 9: Done with @carbon/styles!

And that's it! You're done. At this point you have migrated to use Carbon v11
using the `@carbon/styles` package.

If you run into any problems after this point, please feel free to reach out to
us over on Slack or open up a discussion on
[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions/categories/help).
We want to make this migration experience as seamless as possible and will be
monitoring both areas to help out.

## @carbon/icons-react

The `@carbon/icons-react` package has been updated to minimize the number of
exports from the package to help reduce build and compile times. It also has
been updated to remove icons that were deprecated in v10.

<InlineNotification>

If you are using @carbon/react, you can now import icons directly from
@carbon/react/icons.

</InlineNotification>

### Changes to size

This update includes a change to the API of the icon components that come from
this package. Previously, we would export icons that included the size of the
asset. This update allows you to bring the icon directly and specify the size
using the `size` prop.

**Before**

```jsx
import { Add32, Add24, Add20, Add16 } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add32 />
      <Add24 />
      <Add20 />
      <Add16 />
    </>
  );
}
```

**After**

```jsx
import { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Add size={32} />
      <Add size={24} />
      <Add size={20} />
      <Add />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Removed icons

The following deprecated icons have been removed. Use the table below to find
their replacement, if available, in v11.

| Asset                           | v10                         | v11                         |

## carbon-icons

The `carbon-icons` package has been deprecated and is no longer supported. To
use icons from the Carbon Design System, you should install the appropriate
library to use with your framework:

| Package                 | Framework          | Link                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@carbon/icons-react`   | React              | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-react)   |
| `@carbon/icons-angular` | Angular            | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-angular) |
| `@carbon/icons-vue`     | Vue                | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-vue)     |
| `carbon-icons-svelte`   | Svelte             | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/carbon-icons-svelte)   |
| `@carbon/icons`         | Vanilla JavaScript | [Link](https://npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons)         |

If you are using `@carbon/react`, you can directly import icons from
`@carbon/react/icons`.

## Elements

The packages that we ship for the IBM Design Language have been updated in v11.
The most notable change is that these packages now require Dart Sass in order to
compile as they now use Sass Modules to improve compilation times.

If you were directly importing from one of these element packages, consider
importing from either `@carbon/styles` or `@carbon/react` instead. Both of these
packages provide entrypoints for elements packages on top of the styles for
Carbon itself.

For teams using these packages directly, you will need to update each of the
elements packages you're using to the latest version.

```bash
npm install @carbon/<package-name>@latest
```

Or, with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn upgrade @carbon/<package-name>@latest
```

Afterwards, you will need to update the import paths and import names themselves
that you bring in. In general, each package now supports importing from the
package directly and all `carbon--` prefixed variables, mixins, and functions
have been renamed to remove the prefix.

For full details fo the changes to each elements package, check out the links
below.

If you were previously using the `@carbon/import-once` package, you can continue
to use this in v11. However, this package will receive no further updates after
Carbon switched to using Sass Modules.
