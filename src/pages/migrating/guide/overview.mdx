## Overview

Carbon v11 focuses on quality of life updates for designers and developers. This
update includes:

- Changes to how we name our tokens to make them easier to use
- Improved theming to enable light and dark mode support in product
- The introduction of CSS Grid to build robust layouts on top of the 2x grid
- A 90% decrease in compilation for Styles from Carbon
- Updates to the accessibility of our components

With no changes to the IBM Design Language, v11 will not require any
brand-driven product redesigns.

## Changelog

The v11 release of Carbon is focused on improving the designer and developer
experience of using Carbon. This release does not include any changes to the IBM
Design Language and will not require any Product UIs to be visually redesigned.

use aspects of v10 in v11, such as color tokens.
