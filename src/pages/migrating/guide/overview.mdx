## Overview

Carbon v11 focuses on quality of life updates for designers and developers. This
update includes changes to our token names for ease of use, component API
updates for a more predictable developer experience, along with new features
like CSS grid in order to build robust layouts on top of the 2x grid. With no
changes to the IBM Design Language, v11 will not require any brand-driven
product redesigns.

use aspects of v10 in v11, such as color tokens.
