## Overview

Carbon v11 focuses on quality of life updates for designers and developers
including token and prop renaming for ease of use, component API updates for a
more predictable developer experience, and introducing CSS grid for accurate
layout building in line with the design language.

With no changes to the IBM Design Language, v11 will not require any
brand-driven product redesigns.

Migrating to Carbon v11 comes with many changes to our system that will help
designers and developers build faster, increase flexibility, and improve ease of
use.

### What’s changing

- **APIs:** Size prop naming conventions have been updated to be consistent
  across all components.
- **Color tokens:** Existing tokens have been renamed to better reflect
  their usage and new tokens have been added to fill existing color token gaps
  in our system.
- **Sass modules:** Carbon styles have been updated to use its own dedicated
  package and is transitioning to Sass modules.
- **Theming:** New support for inline theming and light or dark modes.
- **Design kit:** A new v11 Beta kit has been created with color token updates
  for testing purposes.
- **Components:** A new one-package install along with new components and API
  updates.
- **Grid:** New CSS Grid support to make it easier to build layouts.

### What’s not changing

- There are no changes to the IBM Design Language.
- Product UIs do not need to be visually redesigned.
- Existing color tokens with name changes will continue to work in v11.
- Assets that are deprecated in v10 will remain in v11 and will be removed in
  v12.
