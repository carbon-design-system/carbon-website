## Updates

This section covers the new features and updates that are introduced in Carbon
v11. If you're looking for how to migrate a project from v10 to v11, check out
our [Getting started](#getting-started) section above.

You are not required to use any of the new features introduced in this release.
Instead, they are meant to be gradually adopted over time when the use case
comes up in your product. Each section will given an overview of the changes and
will help you understand how to learn more about the feature in v11.

For an overview of all the changes in this release, check out our
[Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md)

### Theming

One of the first areas we revisited in v11 was our color tokens. We heard from
you all that the names of tokens can be confusing and hard to understand, making
it difficult to accurately apply them without constantly referencing our site.

To address this, we investigated several ways to represent usage directly in the
token name in order to make them more intuitive to use. After discussing these
various options and going through rounds of feedback on GitHub, we decided on an
approach that makes it easier to understand and apply tokens based on their
usage.

To learn more about the new color tokens, check out our
[Color Guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage). You
can also learn more about concepts like layering
[here](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/implementation).

#### Light & Dark mode

All of these updated color tokens are now shipped as CSS Custom Properties in
v11. This technique makes it incredibly simple and performant to customize the
theme of your product. We're most excited about using this for Light & Dark Mode
support in products.

This technique also can allow teams to customize a specific area of the page, a
specific component, or other models within their product. The best part is that
any component using our color tokens just works, regardless of the page or
inline theme.

#### Typography

Type tokens are being updated in v11 along with the changes to color tokens.
These changes involve mostly name changes. The values and roles of these tokens
remain the same between v10 and v11.

To learn more about the new type tokens in v11, check out our
[Typography Guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/productive/).
If you're curious about specific changes to tokens, take a look at our
[v11 Migration Docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md#type-tokens).

### Design kits

#### Figma

All v11 theme libaries are now available in Figma. Head to the
[design kit catalog](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/design-kits?tool[]=figma)
to see the full list of available libraries. We have leveraged Figma's latest
features in this release, which may result in breaking changes to some of our
components. To meet team's migration preferences, we have separate v11 and v10
libraries. If you are still on v10, migrate to the v11 libraries when you are
ready to do so.

### New packages

Carbon v11 introduces new code packages to simplify how you bring Carbon into
your project. For many teams, you may be installing several packages in order to
use Carbon, including:

- carbon-components
- carbon-components-react
- carbon-icons
- @carbon/icons-react

Starting in v11, the styles, React components, and icons are all available under
the @carbon/react package. Each of the packages above can still be downloaded
individually but we brought them together to simplify bringing Carbon into your
project.

The @carbon/styles package is also being introduced in v11. This package
contains all of the Sass styles for our components and is being re-exported by
@carbon/react. The Sass styles in this package have gone through a number of
updates as we've shifted over to Dart Sass in order to improve our compile times
by over 90%.

### Dart Sass

Sass files in Carbon now require Dart Sass in order to compile. The decision to
move towards Dart Sass was made after the announcement in the blog post, LibSass
is deprecated. Like many of you who use Sass, we've relied heavily on LibSass
through projects like node-sass. We would not be where we are today without all
the hard work and effort that went into these projects.

#### Sass Modules

With the transition to using sass, Carbon has updated its Sass files to leverage
Sass Modules. This new module system was introduced in 2019 and we knew that it
would be a great fit for the way Carbon authors and ships Sass files.

This new module system created an opportunity to simplify how you bring styles
into your project from Carbon, while drastically reducing compile times. The
best part is that you can still `@import` any of the files from Carbon if you
would like, there is no requirement for you and your project to move to Sass
Modules in order to benefit from these changes.

#### Compile time improvements

One of the most common and frustrating challenges team can run into when using
Carbon are long Sass compilation times. Parts of this were related to how Carbon
was structured, other parts were related to toolchains, but overall we are
incredibly excited to announce that we drastically improved the performance of
compiling Carbon Sass files in v11.

Through moving to Dart Sass, migrating to Sass Modules, and changing our overall
file structure we were able to achieve a 90% in average recompilation times when
using `sass-loader` along with a 60% reduction in initial build times.

### CSS Grid

We're shipping a brand new way to incorporate the 2x Grid in code using a
technique in CSS called CSS Grid. This implementation ships alongside our
Flexbox-based grid that currently exists in v10 and we will continue to support
both in v11.

CSS Grid, along with CSS Custom Properties, makes it easier to build more
resilient products on the Grid through CSS Grid-specific techniques or through
new features that we're able to bring like sub-grid for more complex products.

If you're building on any of our Grid components in v10, every one of these will
continue to be supported in v11. If you would like to learn more about how to
use CSS Grid in your project, you can check out our documentation in
[React](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/elements-grid--default).

### React Components

We're shipping several new components in v11 to accompany the changes that we're
making to styles. Theming, layering, CSS Grid, and more are all available as
components in our React library.

We're also using this release to address some of the outstanding accessibility
issues for components like Notification and Tooltip along with consistently
applying how we name and define certain prop types in v11.

#### Theming and Layering

In order to support the new theming features coming to v11, we're shipping
components like GlobalTheme and Theme to make it as easy as possible to change
the theme of an entire page or a sub-section of a page. These components are
paired alongside the useTheme hook to allow component authors to access the
current theme for a given context.

We're also introducing a new Layer component to simplify how layering is
accomplished in v11. Previously, we used the light prop to address the layering
needs for the white and g10 themes. Now, the Layer component can be used along
with contextual tokens to implement layering across themes.

#### Grid

The default grid in v11 is now implemented using CSS Grid. As a result, you'll
only need to use two components to build layouts on top of the 2x grid: Grid and
Column. For teams that already have layouts built on the flexbox version of our
grid components, rest assured you can update your code to use FlexGrid along
with the existing Row and Column components and your layouts will continue to
work as expected.

#### Accessibility updates

In order to ship accessible versions of some of our components, we've made
updates or breaking changes to either change or remove inaccessible behavior.

For example, our Notification component no longer accepts interactive content as
the semantics of this context would be stripped from users of Screen Readers. To
better support common use cases of components where interactive content was
needed, we are also shipping new components like Actionable Notification to
offer a better, accessible experience for these use cases.

Tooltip, TooltipIcon, and TooltipDefinition are also receiving updates in v11
and mirror some of the changes seen in Notification. For example, Tooltips can
now only contain interactive content. For situations that require interactive
content, we are shipping a new component: Toggletip.

#### Changes to icons

One of the largest changes that came to Carbon in v10 was the set of icons that
we supported. This set grew tremendously due to the hard work of the brand team
at IBM, and we went from supporting around 150 icons to over 1600 as a result.

The package size for these icons quickly ballooned as we shipped an export for
each icon size. In v11, we decided to reduce the complexity of managing a
package that large by shipping the icon as a component and customizing its size
with the size prop.

This approach lead to a 75% decrease in the number of exports and files shipped
through our @carbon/icons-react package and will make it easier to bring this
package into your toolchain.

#### Changes to component size

Speaking of size changes, we have updated the size prop for components in order
to make sizing consistent across all of our components. Before, this prop would
accept a variety of values like field, medium, and short. Now, this prop has the
same names across components to make sizing clearer.
