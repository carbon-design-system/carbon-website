## Components

### Step 1: Install the new package

```
npm -i @carbon/react
```

or

```
yarn install @carbon/react
```

### Step 2: Remove the old packages

```
npm uninstall carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

or

```
yarn remove carbon-components carbon-components-react carbon-icons
```

something here about updating imports to point to `@carbon/react` instead of
`carbon-components-react`, maybe explaing that the components all still work the
same just coming from a diff package now. and why did we do this???

## Sass Modules

Using [Dart-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), we are finally able to use
[the Module System](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched),
dropping the `import-once` helpers that have being causing awful compilation and
build times, re-thinking how developers bring styles into Carbon.

Here are some reasons why we're moving away from Node-Sass and moving towards
Dart-Sass:

- Import Once: To offer better flexibility for importing Sass files, the project
  used a convention to offer style deduplication due to Sass’s @import behavior.
- Long compile times: While this technique would compile fine using Sass CLIs
  directly, tooling like sass-loader would take an increasingly large amount of
  time.
- Incorrect behavior: In certain configurations with Webpack <4 and sass-loader,
  style duplication was not even being prevented.
- LibSass deprecation: When LibSass was
  [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated), and
  subsequently node-sass, we knew it was time to start looking towards Dart
  Sass.

### What this means for you and your team

- Faster compile times: reduced by ~90%
- Faster build times: reduced by ~60%
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### How to migrate

1. Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
   should be automatic.
2. Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
   dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement.
3. In your project you will now use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to
   include the Carbon packages, as seen below.

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific packages, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles).

## Size Prop updates

- Over the years our size props got a little messy. So we updated them, so that
  they are now consistent across all of our components.

### What this means for you and your team:

_add something here_

The props should now look like this:

| Prop Name | Size |
| --------- | ---- |
| xs        | 24px |
| sm        | 32px |
| md        | 40px |
| lg        | 48px |
| xl        | 64px |
| 2xl       | 80px |

## CSS Grid

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid and sub-grid. 🎉

Here is a
[link to our Grid docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/11.x-grid.md).

### What this means for you and your team:

- No longer need `Row` components
- You can drop `Column` components directly into `Grid`
