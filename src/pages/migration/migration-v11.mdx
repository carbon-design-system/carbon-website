This is our v11 migration guide. Here you can find information on how to migrate
from Carbon v10 to v11. With any major migration, there are some exciting new
features we're looking forward to sharing with you all, but of course there are
some breaking changes. We're hoping to have made this transition as smooth as
possible by detailing all of the feature updatess below. This is a constant work
in progress, so please feel free to make any contributions.

</PageDescription>

To start at any point in your migration process you must, first, do the
following:

- Install the `@carbon/react` package

First step, remove the following packages:

- `carbon-components`
- `carbon-components-react`
- `carbon-icons` (yes, we got rid of them...)

carbon-components carbon-components-angular @carbon/vue

## SASS Modules

Since [NodeSass](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) was
officially deprectated, we thought it might be a good time to transition to
using `Sass modules`.

### What this means for you and your team:

- Faster compile times: reduced by ~90%
- Faster build times: reduced by ~60%
- Over-all more flexibility when importing styles

### This is what updating to Sass modules looks like:

- Projects that are currently using `webpack` with `sass-loader` the update
  should be automatic.
- Projects using create-react-app or Next.js, remove `node-sass` from your
  dependencies and add `sass` as the replacement. Find more information
  regarding this process
  [here](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate).
- In your project you will now use the `@use` keyword instead of `@import` to
  include the Carbon packages, as seen below.

To learn more about getting starting with `Dart Sass`, usage, and importing
specific packages, checkout our
[styles docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/styles).

```jsx
// Use all styles
@use 'carbon-components';

// Use all styles with configuration
@use 'carbon-components' with (
  $css--reset: false
);

// Include specific modules
@use 'carbon-components/scss/color';

// Include a component
@use 'carbon-components/scss/components/accordion';
```

### Size Prop updates

- Over the years our size props got a little messy. So we updated them, so that
  they are now consistent across all of our components.

### What this means for you and your team:

_add something here_

The props should now look like this:

| Prop Name | Size |
| --------- | ---- |
| xs        | 24px |
| sm        | 32px |
| md        | 40px |
| lg        | 48px |
| xl        | 64px |
| 2xl       | 80px |

## CSS Grid

A huge change for us this release is dropping support for IE11, which means we
can now support CSS Grid and sub-grid. ðŸŽ‰

### What this means for you and your team:

- No longer need `Row` components
- You can drop `Column` components directly into `Grid`
