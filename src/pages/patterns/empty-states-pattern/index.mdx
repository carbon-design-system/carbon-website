Empty states are moments in an app where there is no data to display to the
user. They are most commonly seen the first time a user interacts with a product
or page, but can be used when data has been deleted or is unavailable.

## Overview

Empty states are a simple yet extremely powerful way to keep a user informed,
supported, and on a productive path. They provide opportunities to communicate
what the user would see if they had data, while providing constructive guidance
about next steps.

With just enough contextual guidance, empty states ensure a smoothness of
experience, especially when things aren’t working as expected.

Most people are familiar with the basic empty state page that explains what data
would normally appear on a page. However, it’s not always a one size fits all.

This pattern explores the following approaches:

- Basic empty states for first use, user action confirmation, and error
  management
- In-depth supplements and alternatives for first use empty states, including
  in-line documentation, onboarding, and starter content

## Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

<Caption>Basic empty state with primary action button</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Image (optional):** A non-interactive image that relates to the situation
   (optional).
1. **Title:** A short and concise explanation. Where possible, write this as a
   positive statement. In this example, "Start by adding data assets" feels more
   positive than "You don’t have any data assets." Alternatively, you could say
   "You don’t have any data assets yet".
1. **Body:** Explain clearly the next action to populate the space. You may also
   explain why the space is empty and include the benefit of taking this step.
   There are three options for explaining the primary action:
   - Direct the user to a primary action button positioned underneath the copy
   - Include a primary action link in the copy
   - Direct the user to the UI element—see the example below. This has the
     benefit of teaching the user where elements are and how they will perform
     tasks in the future.
1. **Primary action—button or link in copy (optional):** The primary call to
   action referenced in the body copy above.
1. **Secondary call to action (optional):** If there is a secondary action, such
   as referencing documentation for further reading, include it as a link below
   the copy.

## Designing with empty states

Empty states are often treated as an afterthought. When designed thoughtfully,
they become an essential part of a smooth user experience, providing just enough
information, in context, to allow users to continue working in a productive way.

During the design process, ask yourself these questions:

- What will the pages, tiles, data tables, and side panels look like without
  content?
- What are all of the steps a user can take to address the situation?
- Is there any useful content that might be available to show?
- How can I turn this situation into something that is engaging and helpful?

During the design phase, explore the full range of options with your team to
ensure that the most appropriate and helpful content is created for each empty
space.

### When to use

Empty states happen for a variety of reasons, and can require different
treatments.

Strive for a balance between the situation and the content you’re providing.
More content doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better solution as there is a
cognitive cost for having more content on the page. This is especially true when
users first engage with your product, so save the more involved educational
moments for primary features and more complex situations.

The following table suggests different approaches for empty states to match the
needs of the user in different situations.

### Where to use

Empty states always appear in the otherwise empty space, in the context of the
data that’s missing. They can occur anywhere your app can display data,
including but not limited to dashboards, data tables, tiles, full pages, and
side panels.

The approach and layout you choose will depend on the situation, and what is the
most appropriate based on the page layout and context.

### Visual guidelines for smaller empty spaces

For small tiles and side panels, follow these guidelines and use the layouts
shown below.

#### Alignment of elements

Empty state elements should be left-aligned as a block. The one exception to
this rule is an empty state in a small tile. In this case the image should be
centered above the left-aligned text and primary action, as shown in the example
below. This exception was made to prevent the empty state looking too much like
content, where it could be skipped over. The centered image in a smaller space
helps to draw attention to a state that may require user action.

#### Image choice considerations

- The image choice should relate to the situation.
- The size of the space for the empty state should also guide the size of image.
  If space is limited, use just text.

#### Multiple empty states

In situations where there could be multiple empty states showing at once, we
recommend using a tertiary button for the call to action. This avoids scenarios
with multiple primary action buttons in the UI.

<Caption>Layout for empty state in a side panel</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Visual guidelines for larger empty spaces

For larger spaces, you have some flexibility with laying out the larger empty
states. Follow these guidelines, review the examples, and use your judgment as
to what is best for the situation.

#### Alignment of elements

Empty state elements should be left-aligned as a block. Depending on the image
you’re using, there are different arrangements available.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of layout types](/images/5_Layout_types_website_image_736.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Layout/positioning options

You have two options for positioning the block in the larger empty states:

- Use a wider left margin
- Block center the left-aligned group in the empty space

#### Image position options

You have two options for positioning the image in the larger empty states:

- Above the empty state title—generally better for wider images
- To the left of the element block—generally better for taller images

#### Image choice considerations

- The image choice should relate to the situation.
- The size of the space for the empty state should also guide the size of image.
  If space is limited, use just text.

#### Best practices

- **Empty states should replace the element that would ordinarily show**. For
  example, an empty state for a table would replace the table and the column
  headers and footer should not be present. This practice avoids having a screen
  reader read the entire table before getting to the message that there is no
  content in the table. Likewise, if you search for something and there are no
  results, any underlying content should be replaced by the empty state message.

- **Consider how many empty states may appear in a space**. If you have a
  dashboard with a number of widgets and there is a failure for multiple widgets
  to load, the repetition of the empty state may not have the same impact if you
  use illustrative icons. In this case, an empty state that uses just text may
  be preferable.

## Types of empty states

### No data empty states

These are the most recognizable first use empty states, explaining what will be
in the space once it is populated with data, and providing guidance for the next
step the user can take to populate the space.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Basic empty state with primary action button](/images/9_Empty_state_full_page_real_content_website_image_1120.png)

<Caption>Basic empty state with primary action button</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Basic empty state with instruction to click UI element](/images/10_Empty_state_data_table_real_content_website_image_1120.png)

<Caption>Basic empty state with instruction to click UI element</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Do:

- Use basic empty states for simpler situations, or secondary features, where
  bite-sized pieces of information are preferable.
- Be specific about what will be available in the space when data is there.
- Keep words to a minimum so they are fast to read and act upon.
- If there is an actionable next step, include a direct link in your message
  copy or a primary action button to make that action fast. Alternatively, guide
  them to what they need to click.

#### Don’t:

- Don’t cover multiple options in one empty state. If there are multiple things
  a user can do, pick the most important and keep the focus on that action.
- Don’t use product-specific terms that the user may not yet understand.
- Don’t include content that is about other areas of the app. Be contextual.
- As a general rule, don’t lead the user into a dead end. If there are useful
  next steps, include them.

### User action empty states

These empty states occur as a result of a user action. For example:

- A message showing there are no search results
- A success confirmation for completion of a process or set of tasks

Explain the reason for seeing the message and providing any follow up steps to
guide the user. For example, if there are no search results suggest adjusting
the search or filters. Links to documentation may also be appropriate as a
secondary call to action.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![A message showing there are no search results](/images/11_Empty_state_search_no_results_website_image_736.png)

<Caption>A message showing there are no search results</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

There may be situations where next steps are not possible or supplementary text
is not required, so use your judgment about what is useful to include. For
example, if your user has configured alerts and nothing has been triggered, it’s
not a case of alerts not being set up but that there is nothing that requires
the user’s attention. In this case, supplementary text is not necessary.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Basic empty state where next steps are not required](/images/12_Empty_state_tabs_website_image_736.png)

<Caption>Basic empty state where next steps are not required</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Error management empty states

Empty states can also occur when there is data but it cannot be surfaced for
some reason. A higher level of specificity is helpful here, with the aim that
the user will be able to address the issue comfortably themselves.

Provide guidance about why there is no data, and either what the user can do to
address the lack of data, or the circumstances under which the data would
appear. And use plain language. Following this fulfills Jakob Nielsen’s ninth
usability heuristic: _Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors_.

> Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely
> indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
>
> <cite>
>   - 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, Jakob Nielsen
> </cite>

Here are some error management situations that may be addressed with the basic
empty state solution.

| Error type               | Explain why there is no data                                                | Explain what the user can do                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Permissions issue_      | The user does not have permission to view the data.                         | Suggest steps or process to request access.                                                       |
| _Systems issue_          | Problems with a related system are preventing the data from being supplied. | Explain steps the user can take to learn what has happened. For example, viewing an activity log. |
| _Configuration required_ | Further configuration may be needed to access the data.                     | Provide an explanation and the first step for the user to take for the required configuration.    |
| _Action not supported_   | For example, the user attempts to upload an unsupported file type.          | Explain what file types are supported.                                                            |

</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Do:

- Consult with your team to explore what information is available.
- If there are corrective actions, give the user an actionable next step.
  Include a direct link in your message copy or a primary action button to make
  the next action fast. Alternatively, guide them to the element they need to
  click.
- Use direct, plain language to describe the situation.
- Be respectful of the user and don’t joke or use flippant language.
- Any images used should reflect the situation and be sensitive to what could be
  a serious situation.

#### Don’t:

- Don’t include content that is about other areas of the app. Be contextual.
- Don’t lead the user into a dead end. Always aim to provide a path to a
  solution.
- If there are multiple things for the user to try, be sure to include a
  hierarchy so that it’s clear which option would be the primary action.

For more detailed information about writing error messages, see the Nielsen
Norman group’s
[Error Message Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/).

A pattern providing guidance for error states is currently being planned. If you
would like to contribute, please see our
[guidelines for contributions](/contributing/pattern).

## In-depth alternatives

Educational content that helps users get oriented and started is another option
for turning an otherwise empty space into a positive and productive experience
for first time users.

When deciding on approaches, a good rule of thumb is that a primary resource on
a page could benefit from a more educational approach, while basic empty states
may suffice for secondary resources.

More educational detail could help to drive engagement.                                                                                                                                                                  |

### In-line documentation

In-line documentation is an extension of the basic empty state for first time
use. It can be most helpful when a primary feature is first introduced,
providing more detail and highlighting any benefits. Including an image of the
space populated with data may help trigger interest and usage. Following a
progressive disclosure model, it could provide links out to more detailed
documentation.

#### Considerations for in-line documentation

- If testing results show that users do not understand the feature or concept,
  more detail may encourage usage.
- This approach may require a higher level of maintenance than a basic empty
  state if using product images as images will need to be kept up to date. If
  your app is translated, there could be extra work in providing localized
  images.
- Keep the content limited to one feature. Do not talk about other areas of the
  app. If there are multiple things a user could do, pick the most important and
  keep the focus on that.

### Onboarding

Onboarding services provide various options for contextual in-app guidance that
can enhance or direct a user through an empty state.

Stepping users through workflows with information that supplements the empty
state messages can get the user to a place of comfort quickly. Tours can point
out the location of features, provide more detail for key tasks, and highlight
benefits. Because onboarding flows are optional for users, they need to be used
in conjunction with basic empty states.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Example of onboarding guidance](/images/15_Empty_state_onboarding_website_image_1120.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Considerations for onboarding

- If metrics are showing that users are not attempting to use a feature, even
  with an empty state, you may need supplementary information. An empty state
  can be used as a launching point for an onboarding sequence, to help users get
  through a process.
- When using an onboarding third party service, metrics can be viewed at any
  time, and adjustments to content can be made and deployed immediately.
- Usually onboarding flows are optional for users, therefore they need to be
  used in conjunction with basic empty states.
- Another aspect to consider is maintenance and the level of commitment required
  to maintain it.

A pattern providing guidance for onboarding is currently being planned. It will
include a framework for matching user needs with design solutions, tips for
writing copy, and general best practices. If you would like to contribute,
please see our [guidelines for contributions](/contributing/pattern).

### Starter content

Another strategy for addressing an otherwise empty space is to provide pre-built
content that allows new users to get started with an app quickly and without any
concern.

#### Pre-built content for apps

Starter content can provide the opportunity for users to dive in and learn about
primary features and functions with sample data. Users can tinker, examining and

#### Pre-configured kits and workflows

Other options for starter content are pre-configured kits and workflows.
Pre-configured kits containing code and API credentials can offer a fast path to
getting started.

Starter content can also take the form of pre-configured workflows, where the
configuration of services is automated, saving users from the tedium of a long
setup process.

#### Considerations for starter content

- Requires upfront planning with the full product team to determine workflow
  pre-configurations that would most benefit users.
- If your starter content can be deleted by your user, you will need a basic
  empty state as a back up.

## Accessibility

As most empty state illustrations are considered decorative, they should be
skipped by screen readers.

A decorative image is one that does not serve any practical or informational
purpose, and is included to fill a visual void. Do not include any informational
content in your decorative image.

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)
require that decorative images are given either an empty `alt` tag or their
`role` is assigned `presentation`. As an empty `alt` tag is more widely
supported, we recommend you align with the WCAG guidance and avoid assigning
`role` to `presentation` until support is more ubiquitous.
