## Overview

Filtering allows users to trim down visible items when working through large data sets. Filters can help a user find something they're looking for, see available options within a certain set of criteria, and make a decision when faced with a large number of options.

Too many filters can also overcomplicate an experience. Consider how much data the user has to work through and how many attributes they will realistically filter by before designing your filter menu.

## The solutions

### Types of filters

| Type                  | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Single selection_    | When the user can pick only one attribute to modify data results. Each filter is applied instantly to the data.                                                                                            |
| _Multi-selection_     | When the user has the option to pick more than one attribute to modify data results. Each selection is applied instantly to the data.                                                                      |
| _Multiple categories_ | When the user has the option to select attributes within multiple data categories. Each filter is applied instantly to the data. If you want to run the filters all at once, use batch filtering.          |
| _Batch filtering_     | When all filters are applied together at the end of the selection process. Can be used for more complex filtering processes and larger data sets to reduce processing load by applying all filters at once |

### Selection filters

#### Single selection

Use a single-selection filter when the user can pick **only one attribute** to modify data results. Under the hood, single selection behaves like a [radio button](/components/radio-button/usage). Types of selection filters include:

- Basic dropdown
- Inline dropdown
- Search
- Radio button set (either standalone or within a menu)

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Multi-selection

Use a multi-selection filter when the user has the option to pick **more than one attribute** to modify the data results. Under the hood, multi-selections behave like [checkboxes](components/checkbox/usage). Types of single-selection filters include:

- Multi-select dropdown
- Inline multi-select dropdown
- Search with tags
- Checkbox set (either standalone or within a menu)

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Multiple categories

A category is a set of filter items within the same topic. For example, "size" is the category and `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `extra large` are the filter choices. Multiple filter categories may be applied to the same data set. For example, the user can filter by size as well as color and price range.

Multiple category selection is typically a vertical list on the left side of the page or within a horizontal drawer at the top of the data set. Multiple categories should never be put within a menu or dropdown.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Batch filter

Use a batch filter when all filters are applied together at the end of the selection process. The data set only refreshes once at user action. The trigger is most commonly an "Apply filter" button.

The batch filter works best when the user is making several filtering selections across different categories that may take a longer time to mentally process. Batch filtering is also a good solution for slow data-return speeds. This can prevent the user from having to wait for the data to load after every selection.

<Column colLg={8}>

#### Interactive filter

An interactive filter returns results after each individual selection is made. The trigger is the individual selection and the filter manipulates the data in real time. This is a good solution for when the user is only selecting from one category or the user is expected to only make one filter selection.

### Filtering states

Each filter interaction should contain the following patterns and states:

- Default start state
- Unselected and selected state
- Filter applied state

#### Starting states

Filters within each category should start either as _all unselected_ or _all selected_. When using multiple categories, the start state can vary from category to category. If the user typically wants only one or a few criteria to be excluded from the results, then all filters should be selected at the start. Vice-versa, if the user wants to see only results related to one particular criteria, then all filters should start as unselected.

#### Filter applied

If the filter(s) can be hidden in either a drawer, dropdown, or menu, then there should be an indicator visible on the closed filter state that informs the user that filters have been applied. At a minimum, the indicator should include the number of filters applied and have the option to clear filters without re-opening the filter container.

<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Resetting filters

Each category should have a way to clear all applied filters at once without having to interact with each individual item. Clearing filters returns the filters to their original default starting state.

If multiple categories have been applied to the same data set then there should also be a way to dismiss all filters across all categories at once.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Row>
