Fluid is an additional component variant with a unique style and behaviors that
differentiate it from the defaults. The fluid component variants manifest our
brand expression by playing with the duality principles of expressive and
productive moments intermingled and applied to product and digital experiences.

## Overview

When we say “fluid,” we mean that the component becomes a part of a larger,
compound component by bleeding to one or more edges of its container. Fluid
variants never exist in isolation; they are always part of another component or
structure, like a modal or form. Fluid is a unique style and particular
expression of a component. Alternatively, the more common style, frequently used
in productive spaces, is known as the default variant.

Default and fluid components share the same functionality but look visually
different as well as have different alignment rules. The fluid name originates
from how the variant respond and where they can be placed. Fluid always hugs at
least one container edges, moving fluidly with the grid as the container
resizes.

| Key term          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed width       | The width of an element is set to a specific value and does not change.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Fluid width       | The width of an element is responsive, often proportionally changing between breakpoints or is set as a percentage of a container.                                                                                                                                         |
| Default variant   | The primary style and behavior of a component that may respond either in a fluid or fixed width manner depending on layout and responsive strategy. They are more productive in nature and are the most commonly used variant.                                             |
| Fluid variant     | An alternative style and behavior available in some components that always has a fluid width. It is a percentage-based element because it comprises part of a greater whole. Fluid variants are more expressive and are used to emphasize an experience.                   |
| Productive moment | A productive experience is all about keeping the user focused and able to complete complex tasks. Productive elements may appear more conservative, confident, and efficient.                                                                                              |
| Expressive moment | An expressive experience creates a desired impact or pause in an experience. They are often used when users are learning, exploring, and interacting through impactful imagery, layout, and long-form reading. Expressive elements may evoke more personality and emotion. |

### When to use fluid variants

- Use in expressive or important moments, to better capture the user’s attention
  and offer a rhythmic break to the productive experience.
- Use within or attached to compound components.
- Use in spacious layouts where the fluid variants have space to expand and
  breath.

### When not to use fluid variants

- Don’t use when white space is needed between input components or in dense
  layout where smaller components may be preferred.
- Don’t use in hyper productive moments like a complex form.
- Don’t use inside accordions or similarly sectioned containers where the edge
  of the fluid component align to the same edge as the accordion dividers
  creating hierarchical confusion.

## Types of fluid components

Not all components come with a fluid variant but each fluid instance has a
default counterpart.

### Fluid inputs

Fluid inputs are an alternative input style with the label placed inside the
input field, aligning with the user input text. All text is contained inside the
field, unlike the default input where the label and helper text sit above and
below, respectively, outside the field container. Fluid inputs only have one
height size at 64px but have a fluid width that hugs one or more edges of its
container. See the individual input components for more guidance on each fluid
component.

### Fluid button

Button alignment determines whether the button is a fixed or fluid element
within a layout. If it is fluid, its width is defined as a percentage (often
50%) of the container’s width and will often be attached to the bottom of the
containers. Fluid buttons cannot be embedded in the middle of a flow/layout.
They must hug the (bottom) edge of a container. Use fixed buttons if additional
options or actions follow below the primary flow and primary action.

A fixed button’s width is calculated by the label’s length plus an additional
64px to the right, with only the left side aligning to grid. Additionally, there
is a hybrid scenario where a fixed styled button can span a designated number of
columns on the responsive column grid giving it a fluid width. For more guidance
on fixed versus fluid buttons, see the button component.

### Fluid containers

Though not a formal component, fluid and fixed containers are applied in various
existing components. Fluid containers, like a modal, calculate their width based
on column spans or percentages and will fluctuate in size. Fixed containers,
like a side panel, maintain a static width, cannot be collapsed and can exist
outside the responsive grid.

### Fluid forms

Fluid forms are architectural and remain cohesive by never allowing vertical or
horizontal space between inputs. Fluid forms use the condensed or narrow grid
mode and can hang into the gutter without causing label misalignment. Default
forms use a wide grid mode and align flush to the grid columns prioritizing
vertical label alignment.

Fluid forms should only be used for simple, straightforward tasks, and any
complex or multi-section forms should use the default style instead. For more
guidance on fixed versus fluid forms, see the form component.

## Designing with fluid

### Visual guidance

#### Alignment

- Fluid component variants are stacked flush to one another with 0px of padding
  between them.
- Default component variants are equally stacked with padding separating each
  component

#### Sizing

- Fluid variant’s width are dependent on its fluid container size or grid column
  span. Fluid components can change per breakpoint or according to their defined
  percentage.
- Default variants may have fluid widths to a certain point but will commonly
  have a max or min width to prevent it from continuously growing

### Best practices

- Fluid variants always appear in a container or as a structural unit. Default
  variants may or may not appear within a container and margins will vary
  according to its location on the grid.
- Together, fluid variants comprise fluid containers, whereas default variants
  can either sit on the page, without a container, or inside a container in with
  inner margins.
- Default and fluid variants can be used together in certain hybrid scenarios.
  The most common is pairing default input components with fluid buttons in a
  contained form, like in a modal or side panel.
- Fluid variants use the condensed or narrow grid modes while default variants
  use the wide or narrow grid mode.
- Fluid component variants need a 3:1 border between them when vertically or
  horizontally stacked.
