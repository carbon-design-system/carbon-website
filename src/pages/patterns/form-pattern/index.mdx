## Overview

### When to use

Forms are incredbily common in product and their design and usage continues to evolve as input methods get smarter. You might design a form for a user to:

- Sign up for / log into an account
- Register for a service
- Reconfigure settings, (e.g. enabling notifications)
- Take a survey
- Order something
- Provide feedback

### Respect the user

Forms are meant to gather information and guide people with as little fuss as possible. To allow users to scan and complete the form quickly, forms should:

- Respect the user’s time and privacy by only asking for information that  is absolutely necessary
- Group related tasks under section titles to provide more context and make the  interface easier to scan
- Follow a logical, predictable order— e.g first name first, last name second on
- Allow users to stay with a single interaction method for as long as possible (i.e. do not make users shift from keyboard to mouse numerous times in a single form).

### Elements (Anatomy of a form)

Forms are comprised of some or all of the following elements.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

1. **Labels:** Input labels helps users understand what the corresponding inputs mean.
1. **Text inputs:** Enable users to input free-form text.
1. **Data inputs:** Information can be entered through a variety of non-free form input fields as well, (e.g. checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns and selects, file uploader, date pickers, toggles etc.) Visit the individual component pages for in depth details of their specific states and visuals.
1. **Help:** Provides in-context guidance like tooltips, placeholder text, or helper text, to assist the user in providing the right information.
1. **Buttons:** Allows users to submit or exit a form.

## Basic usage (Building a form)

### Labels

Concise labels for text and data inputs help users understand what information is being requested of them.

- Use sentence-style capitalization for all text elements, except: product names and proper nouns — i.e. only the first word of each sentence and proper nouns, like names, are capitalized.
- Although they may be formatted differently, all input components need labels.
- Labels should clearly state the required input.
- Do not use colons after label names.
- Labels are not help text; be succinct (1-3 words only)

</Col>
</Row>

#### Top-aligned labels

Top-aligned labels are Carbon’s default (vs. left-aligned labels) and the only label arrangement currently offered. Top-aligned labels provide a consistent left edge, a close proximity between label and input, and are good for scanability and quick completion.

Advantages:

- Top-alignment enables quick completetion.
- The label length has room to extend or vary, (e.g. other languages).
- When users are entering familiar content and are less likely to make data entry errors, top-alignment is ideal.
- This arrangement is best when fewer form fields need to be presented.

#### Optional vs. mandatory

All fields in a form are assumed required, with optional fields being tagged as so in the label.

#### Deciding what to use

| Control    | Usage                                            | Context                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text input | To capture several words maximum                 | Names; phone numbers; addresses                                         |
| Password   | To collect private data by hiding the characters | Passwords, Social Security Numbers (SSN), PINs, credit card information |
| Text area  | To capture multiple lines of text                | Feedback; support requests                                              |

\*Usage highlights:

- The field widths should reflect the intended length of the content while still aligning to the responsive column or mini unit grid.
- Make sure users can enter their information at smaller screen sizes.
- Truncate when an input is too long to be fully displayed in the field.
- Pre-populate known values when possible, e.g. a default IP address.
- The first required input field in a form should receive focus on presentation to a user

### Data inputs

These controls enable users to provide input on forms by selecting from a set of pre-determined options or a limited range of values. Carbon provides a variety of data input components that enable a user to make a selection. Each component was created to serve a specific use case.

#### Selection controls

Selection controls offer users a selection from pre-determined optoins. When designing, consider how many options you need to present as well as how many items the user may need to select. These considerations will determine which component to use. Common selection controls include: checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploaders, toggles and select lists (combobox and multiselect).

| Control       | Usage                                                                    | Context                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Checkbox      | To select or deselect one or more choices                                | Agree to terms and conditions, add optional items, select all that apply |
| Radio button  | To select only one option from two or more choices                       | Pick type, shipping method, etc.                                         |
| Toggle        | To choose one of two or more binary options                              | Changing user settings; On/off; Show/hide                                |
| File uploader | To upload / attach a file or multiple files to a form                    | Attaching SSl certificates; adding config files to support tickets       |
| Combobox      | To select a single item (with typeahead functionality from a longer list | Choosing a state, country or language preference                         |
| Multiselect   | To select multiple items from a longer list                              | Add a product example for MultiSelect                                    |

\*Usage hightlights:

Radio buttons:

- Pre-select default a default option for the user; if the user selects a different option the default is deselected.
- For null options, provide a radio button with the label “None”

Radio buttons and checkboxes:

- Radio button and checkbox labels fall to the right of the controls
- When possible, arrange the checkbox and radio button groups vertically for better scanability.

Toggles:

- Always label toggles with the affected attribute due to accessibility constraints; color cannot be the only indicator
- A standalone toggle or a checkbox can be used for a single option that a user can turn on or off.
- Toggles are very common controls in instantly updating forms, where submission is not required.

Select lists:

- When you have more than 5 options to present to the user, use a select list (combobox or multiselect), not a checkbox or a radio button.

#### Bound entry controls

Bound-entry controls allow users to input numeric data, like dates and times (e.g. number input, date picker and slider components). They restrict user input and rely equally on keyboard and mouse interactions. They only allow valid entries, so field validation isn’t needed.

#### Deciding what to use

| Control      | Usage                                                                   | Context                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| Slider       | To select one number from a numerical range                             | Percentages, volume, timelines, data visualization |
| Date picker  | To input/select a single localized date or a date range from a calendar | Scheduling trips, meetings and events              |
| Time picker  | To input time in hours/minutes                                          | Scheduling meetings and travel times               |

### Offering help

#### Tooltips

Tooltips can be very useful for providing additional explanation to users that may be unfamilair with a particular form field. They can also offer rationale for what may seem like an unusual request. However, users should not have to dig around for a tool tip to access information that’s essential for the completion of their task.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

Do:

- Use tooltips with the filled “i” (info) icon.
- Use tooltips for explanatory or added information.
- Tootltips are microcontent; keep them concise.

Don’t:

- Tooltips are not catchalls for content that doesn’t fit elsewhere; they must be used intentially and very sparingly.
- Never house essential information in a tooltip.

#### Help text

Help text appears below the input label and assists the user to provide the right information. Help text is always available, even when the field is focused, that’s why it’s the correct choice for need-to-know information. For context or background information that is “nice to have,” use an placeholder text or a tooltip.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

Do:

- Think of help text as crucial information that is secondary to the input label.
- Keep help text as short and specific as possible.
- Only use help text when truly necessary to avoid overloading the user.

Don’t:

- Never use help text in place of field labels.
- Help text should not run longer than the input area.

#### Placeholder text

Placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD). Since placeholder text disappears once the user begins to input data, it should not contain crucial information. When the requested input may be unfamiliar to the user or formatting is in question, use placeholder text.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

Do:

- Limit placeholder text to unfamiliar input types or situations where syntax requirements may be in questions (e.g. date formats).
- Keep hints as short as possible and never out run the input field.

Don’t:

- Don’t use placeholder text to communicate complex and lengthy requirements like password requirements. Instead, use an infotip.
- Don’t provide placeholder text when it isn't necessary.
- Never use placeholder text as a replacement for field labels.

### Buttons

Use a primary button for the main action, a secondary button for secondary actions like Cancel or Discard.

#### Button alignment

Alignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of the container or layout, or full bleed from edge to container bottom. Button alignment depends on the type of form that you are building. We’ll touch on alignment briefly here as it relates to the button component and offer more detailed information about form variations below.

#### Button emphasis

Emphasis refers to the position of the primary button in relation to secondary and tertiary actions. Generally, in our system, buttons are sorted by importance from right to left, however non-dialog / in-page forms are the exception. In these situations we recommend left-aligning primary buttons and button groups with the left side of the form field — regardless of the user‘s window width. Research suggests that this enhances scanability in these scenarios.

Use only one primary button perform. If you’re integrating a component like file uploader that has it’s own primary action button, use a tertiary button in that situation.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

| Alignment | Emphasis | Use case |
| Left-aligned | Primary left | Non-dialog, in-page forms |
| Right-aligned | Primary right | Multi-step forms/wizards when the primary action implies a navigation step forward |
| Full bleed | Primary right | All forms that are presented in dialogs and side panels | \* A dialog form would normally have a minimum of two buttons.

#### Naming actions

Abstract terms like “Submit” give the user the impression that the form is generic. Although brevity is key in buttons, try to tell the user specifically what action your button will perform.

<DoDontExample
  type="do"
  caption="Do use task-specific language in your buttons">
  ![Do use task-specific language in your buttons](images/FPO.png)

</Row>

## Behavior

### Errors and validation

Effective and immediate error messaging can help the user to understand the problem and how to fix it. First, inform the user what has happened, then provide guidance on next steps or possible resolutions. Always present error states on the form, and use inline errors whenever possible.

#### Real-time validation

We recommend validating the users data before form submission. Real-time, inline validation should happen as soon as the field loses focus. This will help to easily identify the elements that need to be corrected.

The validation label below the field should be as informative as possible when describing the issue with the users data. For example, if password limitations require 16 characters, but the user inputs a password with only six characters, the text should read something like, “Password must be at least 16 characters.”

Common user errors include:

— Incorrectly formatting data
— Leaving a mandatory field blank
— Leaving a mandatory field incomplete

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

#### Inline notifications

Notifications come into play when server-side errors are involved — i.e. the user tries to submit a form in it’s entirety and the page is reloaded with the detected errors.

In these situations, use an inline notification as well as inline error messaging wherever possible to help users make the fix. Inline error messages should disappear when the form criteria is met.

### Enabling and disabling buttons

- For short forms that require server-side submission before returning errors, we recommend disabling primary action buttons until all of the form’s requirements are met.
- For longer forms, do not disable primary action buttons because the error messages and the primary action button may not be visible on the screen simultaneously.
- When a user submits a form, disable the primary action button to prevent duplicate submissions.
- If it’s going to take a while to process a form, communicate this to the user with feedback messages and progress indicators (e.g. spinners or progress bars).

### In-line editing

Carbon does not have consolidated guidance around inline editing. Since it’s something a lot of products approach in different ways, we’d like to offer more robust, centralized guidance in the new year.

### Designing for longer forms

Product designers are always asking about the appropriate length for web forms. Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits all answer. Your audience and their intentions, along with the context of your product will determine the solution that’s best for you. Here are several techniques to help make longer forms less overwhelming.

#### Progressive disclosure

Use progressive disclosure to reveal any additional content that may arise based on the user’s previous selection. This kind of show/hide approach allows the user to focus on relevant information while keeping workflows short.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

#### Accordion forms

Accordion forms allow users to dynamically expose and hide sections of related information. Like progressive disclosure, accordion forms allow users to focus on relevant information without having to navigate between pages.

In research that we’ve come across, accordion forms can greatly enhance completion speed and page load times. However the same reseach also suggests that confusion can arise for users when it comes primary action buttons and whether they apply only to sections vs. the full form.

The IoT team has done some design explorations around accordion forms but more design iteration and user testing is needed before Carbon solidifies our guidance around this interaction. Keep an eye out for refined usage examples early next year.

#### Multi-step forms

A multi-step form spreads form fields across multiple screens and incorporates a progress indicator (vertical or horizontal) to track a user’s status step by step. There should be a logical relationship between the fields on each screen and a linear relationship between sections.

This approach is good for saving form progress along the journey and allows users to return to a previous step to review their submissions.

## Designing a form (Structure)

### Layout

#### Form headings

Headings describe the form. The heading should be the largest type size in the form hierarchy. IBM Product UI often uses the \$productive-heading-03 token for this purpose if the form is within a container or a dialog. A larger type size should be used if the form is the only element on the page. The title can also be followed by a short descriptor.

#### Group and section headings

Group headings describe a group of controls and fields within a form. Their size should also be adjusted depending on context and form heading size (i.e. the chosen token should be larger than the field labels but obviously smaller than the form heading. Inputs should be grouped to help users understand what is required of them in a logical way. Try to make the group heading short and precise, but, you can add a short description of the group if necessary..

### Spacing

To ensure there is sufficient spacing between single form elements as well as groups of inputs, use margins, spacers, gutters and key alignments to guide you. Individual input fields default to a 40px height in product and we recommend a margin bottom of 32px between them. However designers can revert to 24px in tighter situations.

On in-page forms, use the responsive grid to drive decisions about layout, gutter and margins. Consistency of alignments and geometries is key. Dialogs and forms within side panels will revert to a box model so designers will revert to mini units to guide field widths.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

#### Separating sections

Vertical spacing between sections form sections also depends on wheter the form is a dedicated page or a diaglog. Spacing between groups should be adjusted in relationship to spacing between individual items. For instance, if vetical spacing between individual inputs is 24px consider a 32px spacer between sections… if the former number is 32px consider 48px for the later etc.

<Row>
<Col colLg={8}>

![For placement only](/images/FPO.png)

</Col>
</Row>

### Columns

Carbon generally recommend single-column forms, simply because multi-column forms are more prone to misinterpretation. However, when faced with larger screen sizes and a lot of empty space, multi-column forms may seem like a good idea. And in certain situations it is appropriate.

If you would like to create a multi-column form, the number of columns should depend on the number of input controls on the page, their relationship to one another, and the screen size of the product window.

Always use common sense to group related fields horizontally. 2-3 inputs on a single line will not cause problems if they logically belong together. Here are some examples:

- [first name][mi] [last name]
- [credit card number][expiration date] [security code]
- [city][state/province] [zip code]

Avoid overloading users with too much information, when a multi-step form may be a better choice.
