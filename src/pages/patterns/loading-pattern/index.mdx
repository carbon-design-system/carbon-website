Loading patterns are used when information takes an extended amount of time to process and appear on screen. Skeleton states and the loading component are two interactions that communicate to users that data is loading and the screen is not frozen.

## Overview

The amount of time information takes to load depends on a number of factors, including processing speed and the quality of a user's connection. The way this loading is presented dramatically alters the perceived performance of an application, especially if the app is performing complex calculations or querying large data sets.

Presenting motion and indicating progress are two effective ways to let a user know their request is successfully processing. The way you indicate loading depends on the amount of time the process will take and the location within an application the process is taking place.

### Types of loading

| Type                                        | When to use                                                                      | Use cases                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Progressive loading](#progressive-loading) | When a page or application will take several moments to load all data            | When data must load into container components like tables and cards.                                                                                |
| [Loading indicators](#loading-indicators)   | When a process must load in place and a user will not be directed to a new view. | — When data processing takes more than a few seconds but no longer than one minute <br />— When data from a user input is being saved or submitted. |
| [Load more options](#load-more-options)     | When a view can only load a small fraction of options or information             | Locations with limited space for options like dropdown menus                                                                                        |

## Progressive loading

When a user first loads a page, it may take several moments for all information and page elements to populate. To give the impression of progress, you can load the page in batches. Loading a page in batches is an intuitive way to display loading progress. The simplest view of the page loads first, followed by progressively more detailed batches until the entire viewport has loaded.

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _When a page view is slow to load_                      | Pages that heavily leverage containers, like dashboards, often source data from multiple sources and can be slow to load.                               |
| _When a user changes filters or facets in a table view_ | Tables are often sourcing information from massive data sets. Processing may take a few moments before populating when a user changes selected filters. |

### Behaviors

The first batch should show a page's basic structure and include any text not reliant on processing, like text in an application's shell. This simplified view of an application is called a [skeleton state](#skeleton-states).

Following batches will include images, content outside of the viewport, interactive components, and data-based text.

Not all items need a skeleton state and can be expressed as negative or white space until they load. For example, an image can be shown as an area of white space until the full image loads.

### Skeleton states

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

Skeleton states are simplified versions of components used on an initial page load to indicate that the information on the page has not fully loaded yet. They should only appear for only a few seconds, disappearing once the actual content populates the page.

Skeleton states improve a web app's perceived performance as the app appears to load faster than it actually does, and uses motion to convey that the page is not stuck loading.

Only use skeleton states on container-based components like tiles and structured lists or data-based components like data tables and cards. In most cases, action components (e.g. buttons, input fields, checkboxes, toggles) do not need to have a skeleton state.

Never represent toast notifications, overflow menus, dropdown items, modals, and loaders with skeleton states. Elements inside a modal may have a skeleton state, but the modal itself should not.

## Loading indicators

Loading indicators signal a user action is processing. Unlike progress bars, loading indicators only signal that loading is occurring and do not give any indication of progress.

Full-screen loading indicators tell a user the entire application is processing, while inline indicators show that a specific selection or action is processing. Only use progress indicators if a process will take more than a moment or two to complete.

### Full-screen loading

If a user action requires the entire page or application to process, place an overlay over the entire page and display a loading spinner.

Let the user know if the process will take more than a few minutes.

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _When an action disables the application_               | If a user's action temporarily disables the application while processing occurs, use a loading indicator and a full screen overlay.                                          |
| _When processing takes more than a few seconds_         | If a loading process will require the application's full resources and will take longer than a moment or two, use a full screen loading indicator.                           |
| _When data from user input is being saved or submitted_ | Saving data following with user input often takes a few moments. Using a loading indicator allows the application to finish processing before allowing the user to continue. |

### Inline loading

Use the inline loading component when a single component is processing. For example, when a user restarts a stopped application, an inline loading component indicates the system is processing the restart request.

## Load more options

There may be times when your application only loads a small fraction of options. A Load more button should be used in these instances to extend the list. Load more buttons are ideal for limiting server load when querying a database is slow or expensive. Using Load more allows the data to load in progressive batches.

## Accessibility

A screen reader should [notify a user](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Notification_of_Loading/Busy) if an application is loading or busy. If the application gets stuck or a process fails, the user should also be notified.

For specific loading accessibility concerns, see the WCAG documentation for [Notification of Loading/Busy](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Notification_of_Loading/Busy) and adhere to accessibility guidelines for the [loading component](/components/loading/accessibility).
