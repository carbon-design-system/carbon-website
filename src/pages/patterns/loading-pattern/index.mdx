Loading patterns are used when information takes an extended amount of time to process and appear on screen. Skeleton states and the loading component are two interactions that communicate to users that data is loading and the screen is not frozen.

## Overview

The amount of time information takes to load depends on a number of factors, including processing speed and the quality of a user's connection. The way this loading is presented dramatically alters the perceived performance of an application, especially if the app is performing complex calculations or querying large data sets.

Presenting motion and indicating progress are two effective ways to let a user know their request is successfully processing. The way you indicate loading depends on the amount of time the process will take and the location within an application the process is taking place.

### Types of loading

| Type                                        | When to use                                                                      | Use cases                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Progressive loading](#progressive-loading) | When a page or application will take several moments to load all data            | When data must load into container components like tables and cards.                                                                                |
| [Loading spinner](#loading-spinner)         | When a process must load in place and a user will not be directed to a new view. | — When data processing takes more than a few seconds but no longer than one minute <br />— When data from a user input is being saved or submitted. |
| [Load more](#load-more)                     | When a view can only load a small fraction of options or information             | Dropdown menus with limited space for options,                                                                                                      |

## Progressive loading

Loading a page in batches is an intuitive way to display loading progress. The simplest view of the page loads first, followed by progressively more detailed batches until the entire viewport has loaded.

The first batch should show a page's basic structure and include any text not reliant on processing, like text in an application's shell. This simplified view of an application is called a [skeleton state](#skeleton-states).

Following batches will include images, content outside of the viewport, interactive components, and data-based text.

Not all items need a skeleton state and can be expressed as negative or white space until they load. For example, an image can be shown as an area of white space until the full image loads.

### Skeleton states

Skeleton states are simplified versions of components used on an initial page load to indicate that the information on the page has not fully loaded yet. They should only appear for only a few seconds, disappearing once the actual content populates the page.

Skeleton states improve a web app's perceived performance as the app appears to load faster than it actually does, and uses motion to convey that the page is not stuck loading.

Only use skeleton states on container-based components (e.g. tiles and structured lists), data-based components (e.g. data tables and cards), and data-based text. In most cases, action components (e.g. buttons, input fields, checkboxes, toggles) do not need to have a skeleton state.

Never represent toast notifications, overflow menus, dropdown items, modals, and loaders with skeleton states. Elements inside a modal may have a skeleton state, but the modal itself should not.

## Loading spinner

Loading spinners are a way to halt user action and clearly indicate that a process is taking place. Use a loading spinner if the user is not rerouted as the result of an action.

### Full-screen loading

If a user action requires the entire page or application to process, place an overlay over the entire page and display a loading spinner.

If the process will take more than a few minutes, you may want to consider additional messaging.

- When data processing takes more than a few seconds but no longer than one minute.
- When data from a user input is being saved or submitted.

### Inline loading

Use the inline loading component when a single component is processing. For example, when a user restarts a stopped application, an inline loading component indicates the system is processing the restart request.

## Load more

There may be times where your application only loads a small fraction of options. A Load more button should be used in these instances to extend the list. Load more buttons are ideal for limiting server load when querying a database is slow or expensive. Using Load more allows the data to load in progressive batches.
