## Overview

This pattern covers the username and password screens seen by users as they log into IBM products. Error states, forgot username/password, and additional authentication methods will be covered in future iterations of this pattern.

### Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/placeholder_guidance.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. Title
2. IBMid
3. Text input
4. Remember me — save login name for next time (as a cookie?)
5. Continue: primary call to action
6. Create account option —
7. Help

### When to use

The login page is presented to users in the following scenarios:

- When a user wants to gain access to an app.
- When a user has logged out voluntarily. They will see a confirmation message after which they will be automatically redirected back to the login page.
- When a user has been logged out due to inactivity. In this scenario, when the user logs back in they should be redirected to the last page they were on, before being logged out.

## Behavior

The Login page should focus on the main task of accessing one’s account. The point of this page is to get the user into their account quickly without complicating the workflow. It’s not recommended to include any distracting information or imagery to the form. Consider the simplest approach to logging into an account on mobile and maintain that simplicity on tablet and desktop.

IBM uses multi-factor login for products. Users gain access to their applications by entering their authentication information progressively. Federated users log in with SSO (single sign-on) and non-federated users are required to provide both their IBMid and password.

Separate the IBMid and password fields into different flows to easily accommodate both federated and non-federated users. However, presenting options to users to “Log in using SSO” or “Log in using IBMid” is not recommended. The IBMid should be requested upfront with a “Continue” button to move forward. This allows the system to distinguish which path the user needs to take in the background instead of making the user read through options and choose.

On the first page, the user enters their username, then clicks Continue. The system validates the username and provides a field for the password only if required.

When users enter their authentication information progressively, the cognitive load is reduced. From this point, the user will either continue to their company’s SSO login experience or they’ll see a password field, a “Log in” button, and a way to return to the prior page in case they made a mistake while filling out their IBMid.

### Best practices

**Do:**

- Use the phrase Log in, not Sign in. This is to make it visually distinct from Sign up. They're often side by side and the different words allow for fast and easy distinction between the two options.
- Use Log in to [Product name], with Log in as two words.
- Let users sign in quickly. Keep the login page uncluttered to reduce cognitive and visual loads.
- Use a clear call to action, that is correctly sized, to reduce the motor load.
- If you're using a split-screen, include a clear division between the types on content on each side. Marketing on one side, login details on the other. Do not mix the two.
- What about considering a simple sign up link on the Log in side? Where Forgot password? and Forgot ID? are located.

**Don't:**

- Don't make users sign in until it's necessary.
- Mix login content with marketing content. Testing has shown that people will miss ...
- Remove fields abruptly. For example, don't show a password field upfront and then hide it when the system recognizes that the email is associated with a federated account.

## Design types

**Single-column layout**

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/placeholder_guidance.png)

<Caption>PLACEHOLDER: Single column layout login page</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

The single-column login form provides a simple entry point for users. Without any distractions on the page, users can focus on their primary goal of signing in to the application or product. Through navigating to the login page, users have already shown intent to log in so additional content about the product isn’t necessary.

**Split-screen layout**

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/placeholder_guidance.png)

<Caption>PLACEHOLDER: Split-screen layout login page</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

The split-screen page is an alternate design that has space to include marketing content. The login portion of this layout uses the same design and behavior as the single-column layout but is confined to the right half of the page. The left half of the page is used for simple marketing content about the product.

The additional content on this page should be minimal and shouldn’t distract from the login form. The user’s primary goal is logging in and that should be reflected the visual design and emphasis on the page.

Keep the marketing and login content separate. Testing has shown users don’t look outside of the login region to find related actions (like create account or SSO buttons) and often miss those actions if they are embedded in the marketing content.

## Accessibility

Ensure that users can tab through the login form and navigate the page using only a keyboard. Use landmark regions to designate the login region and allow screen readers to skip directly to the input fields. This is especially important if you are using the split-screen layout or have additional content on the page.
