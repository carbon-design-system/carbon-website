## Overview

It’s important to keep users informed and send notifications when there is an
update or status change they should be aware of. Users should always be given
appropriate and timely messages to help them understand whether they are moving
towards their goal. Ensure your notifications are relevant, timely, and
informative.

| Key principle | Definition                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relevant      | Notifications should be related to the user’s goals and presented in the context of what they are doing |
| Timely        | Ensure users are kept up to date with prompt notifications and see critical notifications immediately   |
| Informative   | Provide users with the context and next steps needed to understand and address the notification         |

Be considerate of your users when sending a notification. Notifications that are
too frequent or disruptive create negative experiences and drive users from
platforms.

Notifications are comprised of status and type. Their status signifies the
purpose of the information being conveyed. Notification types allow you to
tailor the disruptiveness of the notification to the specific situation.
Notification status and type options in Carbon should be combined to create
notifications that are relevant, timely, and informative for each use case.

## Designing with notifications

### When to use

Use notifications to inform users of important status changes and updates.
Transparency is a core element of building user trust and is the first of Jakob
Nielsen’s
[10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
They should be relevant to the user and as minimally disruptive as possible.
There are two major use cases for notifications: task-generated and
system-generated.

#### Task-generated notifications

Task-generated notifications are initiated in response to user action during a
specific task. They give users direct, immediate feedback. They should be placed
in the region of the page the user is working in and be related to the user’s
action.

You might send a task-generated notification when:

- A form is successfully submitted
- There is a problem uploading a file
- Credentials can’t be found

#### System-generated notifications

These notifications are initiated by the application or system, independent of
user action. They provide updates on background system status or out-of-context
events that have finished.

You might send a system-generated notification when:

- A user loses network connection
- Planned system maintenance is coming soon
- A new report is ready
- The user’s login session is about to expire

### When not to use

Only send notifications where necessary. Confine each notification to the
portion of the interface and workflow it is relevant to. Being interrupted
creates a frustrating and discouraging experience for users, so this should be
limited as much as possible. Additionally, frequent distractions
[lower productivity](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_9#Sec22)
and can lead to [alert fatigue](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/alert-fatigue).

## Notification status

Notification status helps convey the information being communicated. These
statuses correspond with a color and icon to provide a consistent, universal
experience for users.

| Modal              | Highly disruptive notifications that provide users with critical information that needs their attention or action         | Persist and block tasks until dismissed by user. Modals allow more user action than other notifications and can include other Carbon components.               |

### Inline notification

[Inline notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/)
are nondisruptive and confined to a specific area in the UI. Inline
notifications display both task-generated and system-generated messages and
persist until they are dismissed by the user or the notification is resolved.
They are frequently used in conjunction with field-level messages for errors in
forms or other input areas.

Carbon offers low-contrast and high-contrast inline notifications. All inline
notifications use a color that corresponds with their message intent and can
also be accompanied by an icon to reinforce the message intent.

#### Best practices:

- Place inline notifications near their related items.
- In forms, inline notifications can be placed either at the top or bottom.
- Keep the message under two lines.
- Do not cover other content with inline notifications.
- The notification width varies based on the context and page layout.
- Be descriptive and give users clear next steps.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Toast

[Toasts](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/) are
notifications that slide in and out, typically in the top right of the page.
They are more disruptive than inline notifications and are best used with
system-generated messages that do not correspond to a specific section of the
UI.

Carbon toasts can be either low-contrast or high-contrast. Their color should
correspond with the message intent and they can also use an icon to convey the
message intent.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of nonactionable and actionable toast notifications](/images/4_toast_static_736.png)

<Caption>
  Example of atoast notification without actions (left) and actionable toast
  notification (right)
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Long messages

Removing the timestamp provides space for a third line of content for longer
toast messages. Toasts are intended to be at-a-glance messages confined to a
small region of the screen so their messages should not exceed three lines.

#### Best practices:

- Multiple toasts stack vertically, with the newest appearing at the top of the
  list.
- Keep messages clear and concise.
- The timestamp is optional and can be removed.
- Toast notifications have a fixed width and should not be expanded to fit the
  content area.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>Low-contrast toast notifications</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Actionable

[Actionable](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/)
notifications allow for interactive elements within a notification styled like
an inline or toast notification. Actionable notifications, since they require
user interaction, take focus when triggered and can be highly disruptive to
screen readers and keyboard users.

Actionable notifications styled as inline notifications contain only one ghost
button. A small “x” in the top right corner is used to dismiss inline
notifications. Including the close button is optional and should not be included
if it is critical for a user to read or interact with the notification.

Actionable notifications styled as inline notifications can only one action
button. If the toast includes an action button, then the notification should
remain on screen until the user dismisses it. With the notification remaining
open, the user has enough time to interact with the button without the toast
closing too soon.

#### Best practices:

- Do not include rich text inside actionable notifications.
- Actionable notification should persist until user dismisses to give users time
  in interact with the notification.
- Only one action per notification.
- Limit action labels to two words or less.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Banner notification in a product](/images/8_actionable_toast.png)

<Caption>Actionable notification styled as a toast notification</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Banner

Banners take over the top of an interface to show general notifications for the
product or system, not a specific task. They persist until they are dismissed by
the user. Depending on the message, the user resolving a product or system issue
(for example, updating necessary account information), may dismiss the banner.
Banners may also persist across multiple sessions.

#### Best practices:

- Banners should be placed at the top of the content area they relate to.
- Do not cover other content with a banner notification.
- Place system-wide messages directly below the main header or navigation bar.
- Banners are not sticky and should scroll with the other content on the page.
- Only show one banner at a time.

More design iteration and user testing is needed before Carbon solidifies our
guidance for banners and creates a banner component. Keep an eye out for refined
usage examples in the future. If your team has developed a banner component,
consider contributing it to Carbon so that it can be made available to others.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Notification panel

Notification panels are helpful for users who receive a large number of
system-generated notifications or may need to reference their notifications
later. They are used in conjunction with toasts to alert users of notifications
as they come in.

Notification panels ensure that users can access and read all notifications
without cluttering the screen with many persistent notifications. They also
provide a consistent experience to users who need more time to read
notifications, use a screen reader, or prefer to limit the notifications they
receive.

More design iteration and user testing is needed before Carbon solidifies our
guidance for notification panel and creates a notification panel component. Keep
an eye out for refined usage examples in the future. If your team has developed
a notification panel component, consider contributing it to Carbon so that it
can be made available to others.

#### Best practices:

- Give users the ability to manage notification preferences.
- Don’t send the same notification multiple times if users don’t interact with
  it.
- List notifications in chronological order.
- Notifications can be grouped by source or urgency.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Notification panel in a product](/images/6_Panel_736.png)

<Caption>Notification panel with the Gray 100 theme</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Modal

Modals interrupt the user and pause their current task. They are highly
disruptive to users and should be used sparingly. Only use a modal when the
message is critical and needs the user’s immediate attention or action. Modals
persist until users engage with them and only disappear when dismissed by the
user.

#### Best practices:

- Only display one modal notification at a time.
- Use modals when you need to immediately interrupt a user’s task.
- Give users clear steps to resolve and dismiss the notification.

<Column colLg={8}>

## Considerations when designing

### Notification priority

Notifications range in their priority and therefore should vary in their
disruptiveness to users. It is important to match the urgency and priority of
the information being communicated to the visual style and behavior of the
notification.

Carbon offers two visual styles for inline and toast notifications. The
high-contrast style is more visually disruptive and should be used for
notifications that are urgent or critical. The low-contrast style is better for
supplemental messaging or other low priority use cases. Toast and inline
notifications can use different styles, but you should never mix styles within
the variations.

### General user action

#### Optional action

Actionable notifications can include a ghost or tertiary button that lets users
interact with them. Taking action on these notifications should be optional and
should not block the user from continuing with their current task. This action
frequently takes users to a flow or page related to the message, where they can
resolve the notification. All notifications should be dismissed when users
interact with them.

#### Required action

Some notification patterns must block users from dismissing the notification or
continuing with their task until the message has been addressed. This is common
in forms when there are errors or empty input fields. Notifications that prevent
users from continuing should be relevant to the current task and provide the
user with the steps needed to resolve them or continue with their current task.

Blocking users from continuing with a task is disruptive and hinders the overall
experience, so these notifications should only be used when it is critical the
user sees the notification or the user needs to take action right away.

### Notification message

It’s important to consider the user’s context when writing notification
messages. Use language that is accessible to the user and that will be easily
understood. Use a tone that is appropriate for the situation and notification.

Because task-generated notifications are sent in response to user action, it
isn’t necessary to give users extensive background information. Conversely,
system-generated notifications are generally not relevant to the user’s current
task so you should ensure the user has sufficient context to understand the
notification.

## Accessibility

**Don’t use notifications that dismiss on a timer for critical or emergency
messages.** Some users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with
messages and timed actionable toasts may not provide sufficient time.
[WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.4 (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-timing.html)

**Users should be able to manage or limit noncritical notifications.** This
gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions they
receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive limitations.
