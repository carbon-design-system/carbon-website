Design patterns solve common problems by defining and standardizing solutions. They help product designers apply components to lead users through common workflows.

## About patterns

Patterns comprise common user flows and scenarios which are too complex to be encapsulated in a single component. Individual patterns often include two or more components from the system or apply to multiple components independently.

## Anatomy of a pattern

### Overview

- Name
- Problem Statement
- User needs statements
- Status: Design available, production ready, design beta, dev prototype
- Goals
- Image example of the action
- Hierarchy and placement

### Behavior guidance

- Do's and Don'ts (for components only)
- Examples and scenarios
- Interactions
- States
- UX diagram
- Considerations
- Motion

### Assets

- Related page templates
- Sketch or other design software assets
- Layouts/templates included in a pattern

### Reference

- Demos (functional prototype)
- Accessibility
- Design specs
- Dev notes

### MetadataÂ 

- Change log
- Related components
- Related patterns
- User research
- Tags (including status)
- Maintainer
- Known issues and gaps
- Next steps (similar to status. What work is planned to happen next)

| Production patterns                            |                                                                                                             |

| [Common actions](/patterns/common-actions)     | These are the frequently used actions that appear multiple times across different components and workflows. |
| [Disabled states](/patterns/disabled-states)   | Are used to completely remove the interactive function of a component.                                      |
| [Filtering](/patterns/filtering)               | Is the mechanism by which a user adds or removes data items from a displayed data set.                      |
| [Overflow content](/patterns/overflow-content) | Is text, such as a paragraph or a text string, that exceeds a desired space.                                |

| Experimental patterns                                  |                                                                                |

| [Chatbots](/experimental/chatbot)                      | Are used to request information on demand via natural language.                |
| [Deleting pattern](/experimental/deleting-pattern)     | Safely guide a user through the destruction of an asset.                       |
| [Export pattern](/experimental/export-pattern)         | Exporting a resource saves data in a different format, external to the system. |
| [Navigation pattern](/experimental/navigation-pattern) | Solve navigation for common information structures.                            |
