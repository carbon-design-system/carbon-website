| Production patterns                              |                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Common actions](/patterns/common-actions)       | These are the frequently used actions that appear multiple times across different components and workflows.                                          |
| [Disabled states](/patterns/disabled-states)     | Are used to completely remove the interactive function of a component.                                                                               |
| [Empty states](/patterns/empty-state-pattern)    | Empty states are moments in an app where there is no data to display to the user.                                                                    |
| [Filtering](/patterns/filtering)                 | Filtering is the mechanism by which a user adds or removes data items from a displayed data set by turning on and off certain predefined attributes. |
| [Forms](/patterns/form-patterns)                 | A form is a group of related input controls that allows users to provide data or configure options.                                                  |
| [Global header](/patterns/global-header-pattern) | Users rely on the global header to navigate and orient themselves in your UI.                                                                        |
| [Loading](/patterns/loading)                     | Loading patterns are used when information takes an extended amount of time to process and appear on screen.                                         |
| [Notifications](/patterns/notification/pattern)  | Notifications are an important method of communicating with users and providing feedback.                                                            |
| [Overflow content](/patterns/overflow-content)   | Is text, such as a paragraph or a text string, that exceeds a desired space.                                                                         |
