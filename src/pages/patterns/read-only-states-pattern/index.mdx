## Overview

Read-only inputs are applied to components that can be modified in their enabled
state. These components are considered active, and any data they contain may be
used in an application’s processes. This state change transforms a component’s
purpose to be purely informative.

### When to use

There are three main use cases that initiate a read-only state:

| Use case            | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application process | An application’s process temporarily restricts a user from modifying the component until the process completes. |
| Locked              | An application restricts the number of users that can modify the component at the same time.                    |
| Permissions         | A user’s credentials allow them to view the component but not modify it.                                        |

### When not to use

- If the component does not have an enabled state, do not use a read-only state
  to display static information.
- As an alternative to a disabled state—read-only and disabled states serve
  different purposes. For example, when a component is temporarily unavailable
  pending user actions or decisions (such as completing a form or choosing an
  option), the component's state should be temporarily disabled, not read-only.
- If the component would otherwise be disabled, components in a disabled state
  should not change to a read-only state.

## Formatting

### Anatomy

Read-only states use subtle changes to a component’s style to emphasize critical
information and de-emphasize or remove signifiers.

### Structure

Components should maintain the same structure and spacing used in the
component’s enabled state. In most cases, elements in the enabled state should
be present in the read-only state.

#### Colors

Color changes to interactive elements and signifiers are used to de-emphasize
unavailable affordances in a component’s read-only state. The color of key
informational elements (text, icons, and visualizations) should remain the same
as the component’s enabled state.

#### Component fields

Color of field background changed to blend with the overall background.

Tag background replaced with a border.
