<PageDescription>

Search takes a blank state and adds to it based on criteria that matches. It's like a conversation between the user and system: the user expresses their information need as a query, and the system expresses its response as a set of results.

## Basic search

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### When to use basic search

**Choose basic search when there are space constraints in your design.** It can also be component-specific. For example, small search can be used to filter data within a data table.

**Do not use basic search for a global search bar.** Basic search is intended for focused search within a page or component.

Use this pattern when:

- It can help users navigate large or complex websites and applications
- You provide a service through information delivery, like a portal

### How basic search works

At the atomic level, search is composed of:
an input field
a button to run the search query

The search input field should make use of helpful placeholder text to suggest what the user should search for. Placeholder text should be short as to not increase the cognitive load.
At its smallest width, the search input field should be able to accommodate at least 27 characters of text.
When the search box component is a global search, it almost always appears in the middle of the global header for easy access.

## Global search

<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

### When to use large search

Use global level when a user is searching content within a page view.

### When not to use large search

If large search is already in use at the top of a page, avoid using a large search within a page or component. This can confuse a user as they may percieve the embedded, focused search as a global search.

### How large search works

The results from a large search should be as exhaustive as possible. While you should avoid returning unrelated results, a large search should emcompass all possible results.

When using this method, you should:

- Offer live search suggestions
- Categorize the search results if they come from different areas
- Give the user control over their viewing options and ability to sort results
- Have a clear, “no results,” message and offer suggestions if possible
- Include enough of a description in the results for users to make a judgement as to whether that particular result is relevant
- Highlight the search term in the results, where appropriate

**Fuzzy search is critical to a user's experience when searching.** While you may believe the name you've applied to elements within your application or website are intuitive, a new user may have a totally different perception. Try to return any potential matches to a search result.

## Targeted search

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![targeted search](/images/targeted-search.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### When to use targeted search

Targeted search allows users to quickly and easily search within a specific category so they can find more relevant content.

### When not to use targeted search

Don't use targeted search for global searches, which are performed at a high level in order to locate unknown content. The targeted search should be used for scenarios when users understand what they need.

### How targeted search works

Users often need to search for and find known items of interest in specific categories of data. Targeted search allows users to narrow the search to a specific category, avoiding the need to navigate irrelevant search results.

When using targeted search, you should:

- Limit search results to a small number of items
- Keep the search field populated with the user’s input after the query is submitted
- Clear the search field and results when the user navigates away from the interface containing the search field.
