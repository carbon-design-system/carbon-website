<PageDescription>

Search takes a blank state and adds to it based on criteria that matches. It's like a conversation between the user and system: the user expresses their information need as a query, and the system expresses its response as a set of results.

#### When to use large search

Use global level when a user is searching content within a page view.

#### When not to use large search

If large search is already in use at the top of a page, avoid using a large search within a page or component. This can confuse a user as they may percieve the embedded, focused search as a global search.

#### How large search works

The results from a large search should be as exhaustive as possible. While you should avoid returning unrelated results, a large search should emcompass all possible results.

When using this method, you should:

- Offer live search suggestions
- Categorize the search results if they come from different areas
- Give the user control over their viewing options and ability to sort results
- Have a clear, “no results,” message and offer suggestions if possible
- Include enough of a description in the results for users to make a judgement as to whether that particular result is relevant
- Highlight the search term in the results, where appropriate

**Fuzzy search is critical to a user's experience when searching.** While you may believe the name you've applied to elements within your application or website are intuitive, a new user may have a totally different perception. Try to return any potential matches to a search result.

### Targeted search

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

#### When to use targeted search

Targeted search allows users to quickly and easily search within a specific category so they can find more relevant content.

#### When not to use targeted search

Don't use targeted search for global searches, which are performed at a high level in order to locate unknown content. The targeted search should be used for scenarios when users understand what they need.

#### How targeted search works

Users often need to search for and find known items of interest in specific categories of data. Targeted search allows users to narrow the search to a specific category, avoiding the need to navigate irrelevant search results.

When using targeted search, you should:

- Limit search results to a small number of items
- Keep the search field populated with the user’s input after the query is submitted
- Clear the search field and results when the user navigates away from the interface containing the search field.
