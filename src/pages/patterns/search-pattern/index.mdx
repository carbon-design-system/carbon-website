<PageDescription>

Search is an essential pattern for navigation or discovery. We live in the age of search, where a search engine is often the primary entry point into the internet. User expectations are high for the way search should work, and consistency is critical.

## Overview

Searching is an intuitive method of discovery, offering users a way to explore a website or application using keywords. Most searches begin broad, with the scope narrowing as filters are applied.

There are three primary types of search:

- Basic search
- Active search
- Focused search

The method of search you should implement depends on the size of the data set being searched and the location of the search within your product.

The placement of your search field depends on the construction of your application and the scope of the search. For global searches, see the [global header pattern](/patterns/global-header-pattern) for placement guidance. See the [data table](/components/data-table/usage#search) component for search placement within a data table.

            Actively searches a database and lists the top results in results
            panel or on the current page. For example:
            <UnorderedList>
              <ListItem>Searching a catalog</ListItem>
              <ListItem>Searching a small website</ListItem>

## Basic search

Basic search entails any search that directs users to a distinct results page.

In certain scenarios, the scope of a search is too large for a [live query](#active-search) to be practical. Consider searches of a massive database or web searches. In these instances, offer either trending searches that match the user’s keywords, recent searches by the active user, or both.

The search won’t run until the user clicks or taps the Search button.

### Search field

Every search must be composed of an [input field](/components/search/usage) and a way to run the search query, like a clickable search icon or pressing ENTER. The search input field should provide helpful placeholder text with search examples.

Placeholder text should be short and clear, hinting at what the user can search for. For example, “Search for networks or devices.”

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Do provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon](./images/2_do.png)

<Caption>Do provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

**Avoid adding a label to your search field.** Users expect and understand search fields, and no label is necessary. A search icon along with useful placeholder text should clearly indicate that the field is intended for search.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Don't include a label for most search fields. Users know and expect search fields.](./images/2_dont.png)

<Caption>
  Don't include a label for most search fields. Users know and expect search
  fields."
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

**Add a scope filter to your search field.** The optional scoped search allow users to limit their searches to a section or category of content on a website, as opposed to a global search that searches everything at once.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of a scope filter on a search field](/images/5.png)

<Caption>Example of a scope filter on a search field</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

Only one scoped category can be selected at a time. The dropdown should always include an "All" option, and "All" should be selected by default. With "All" selected, the field will function as a [basic global search](#basic-search).

### Real-time feedback

Provide users with feedback as they type. When a user clicks or tabs into a search field, they should be shown a menu of either the user's recent searches, trending searches, or both. These will disappear when the user types in the field, and the menu will be replaced with suggestions based on their search query. These should continue to update and refine as the user types.

The real-time feedback you give a user depends on the data your application contains and the load you're willing or able to place on your servers. At minimum, you should include type-ahead suggestions for likely search entries. Type-ahead suggestions are search suggestions based on general search patterns from all users and place minimal load on servers.

If you want to run the query after each character, see [active search](#active-search).

Consider grouping results sourced from distinct data sets or categories. If you group suggestions, consider offering a 'Search within this category' option beneath the search category header, or use a [focused search](#focused-search) instead.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/6.png)

</Column>
</Row>

**Provide type-ahead suggestions.** Suggestions give a user immediate feedback on their search. Without committing to a search, they can see a preview of results, suggestions of additional search terms, or zero in on exactly what they were looking for. Type-ahead suggestions should begin as soon as the user begins typing in the search field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of type-ahead suggestions](/images/7.png)

<Caption>Example of type-ahead suggestions</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Results page

Once the user runs the search, they are directed to a distinct results page. On this page, the user should have the option to select filters to narrow their search results. If you’d prefer to offer filters before the user searches, consider adding a scope filter.

The order in which suggestions are displayed should be organized by relevancy from top to bottom. If it makes sense for the website or application, type-ahead suggestions should be grouped in a similar order.

The design of the results page will depend largely on the needs of your product, and more specific design guidance for a search results page will be covered in future pattern guidance.

### Best practices

- **If you choose to offer filters, they should be grouped by logical categories with clear labels.** For more specific guidance on filtering, see [filtering](/patterns/filtering).
- **Always include the number of search results, including for searches with no results.**
- **If a search returns "No results," suggest a follow-up action.** Provide suggestions and helpful resources to ensure the user finds what they are looking for. For more on failed searches, see the [empty states pattern](/patterns/empty-states-pattern).
- **Include a progress bar for advanced, resource-intensive searches.** Let the user know how far along the search is, and roughly how long it will take.
- **Include a loading indicator if the search will take longer than a moment or two.** Your loading state should reflect your empty state with useful helper text signaling that the search is still ongoing.
- **Flip the layout of the search box for languages that read right to left instead of left to right.**

## Active search

An active search is a rapid way to search an application or data set. The search runs after each character is entered, and results are shown right below the search field. You can think of active search as a way to filter a dataset through keywords.

Active searches should be used in instances where the search is likely to return an accurate result, like a small website or data table with limited data. The search query runs following each added or removed character in the search field.

You can also use active search when looking through a catalog of items, like a product catalog or a library.

### Search field

An active search is constructed from a search field, a search icon, and an X that serves as a clear or cancel button. There is no Search or Go button, as the search is run actively and the user is not routed to a results page.

Active search placeholder text should be more specific than a basic search and should remain visible until the user begins typing in the search field.

You can optionally add a 'See all results' item to your results panel, which when clicked behaves as a [basic search](#basic-search).

If you are using active search for a catalog or library, don't show a panel below the search field. The items on the page should update as the user enters their search.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of an active search field](./images/11.png)

<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Presenting results

Active search is intended to be a quicker search-in-place experience. The user should find what they're looking for in the results panel.

You can also implement active search among a small set of information displayed on a full page, like a catalog of offerings. Before the search is run, all items should be displayed. Once the user begins typing, only show items on the page that match the user's search.

Recent searches from the active user should appear in a panel below the search field and should be replaced by matching search results the second the user begins typing. Do not show trending searches, as active search is typically used for more focused scenarios and its unlikely trending searches will meet the needs of a user.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/placeholder_guidance.png)

<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Best practices

- Once the user selects a result, they should be taken to the selected page or resource immediately.
- You can cluster results by category or subset, however, users searching within several categories may be better served by a [focused search](#focused-search).

## Focused search

A focused search is a combination of basic search and active search. The user is [actively shown results](#active-search) within their immediate page, product or scope. Below those results, they have the option to widen their scope to search all available data.

Focused search is ideal for users who are using a specific tool that is part of a catalog or suite.

### Search field

A focused search should query results related to the search's focus, whether that is a user, a category, or a data set. The search results should be presented in a panel just like in [active search](#active-search), but below the results should be a button to widen the scope and see a full page of search results.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![FPO](/images/placeholder_guidance.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Presenting results

Once a user has clicked or tabbed into the focused search field, a menu should appear with recent searches from the active user, suggestions specific to the user or session, or both. Once the user begins typing, the suggestions should disappear and the results should refine following each character entered.

You can also cluster active results by category with the option to 'Search within category.' This is ideal for a user who may be searching within several similar data sets without prior knowledge where the information lives. If the user is likely to know the location of their data, offer a scope filter.

A successful focused search will route a user directly to a page or resource. In the event the user does select 'See all results,' the user should land on a dedicated [results page](basic-search). Always include the number of search results, including for searches with no results.

### Best practices

- If the user chooses a subcategory from the results panel, the search functions like a [basic search](#basic-search) with a filter applied.
- Any selected filter should persist during future searches until the user either discards the filter or begins a new session.

## Accessibility

### Search

Users should be able to `TAB` into the input field of the search box to begin typing and press `ENTER` to run the search query.

If using a scope dropdown and/or type-ahead suggestions, those should also be navigable by keyboard. For scope, `TAB` should select the dropdown and the `ARROW` keys should open it to cycle through the menu. `ENTER` should make a selection from the dropdown and advance the user to the input field of the search box.

For type-ahead suggestions, the `ARROW` keys should cycle through displayed suggestions, with `ENTER` choosing a suggestion and `ESCAPE` allowing the user to exit the type-ahead menu without selecting anything.

### Faceted filtering

Users should be able to `TAB` into the filter panel to cycle through the different groups. Pressing `ENTER` moves the selection to the facets inside a group, allowing the user to move through the facets with the `ARROW` keys. Pressing `ENTER` while a facet is in focus would toggle select or deselect the facet.

After a facet is selected or deselected, the focus state should be retained as the content reloads, that way users don’t have to `TAB` through everything again as they move down the list.
