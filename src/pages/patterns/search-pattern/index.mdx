## Basic search bar

Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant pieces of content.

The basic search bar contains the following:

- A search input, including descriptive placeholder text
- A search icon-only button, which triggers the search
- A clear icon-only button, revealed when the input contains a value and has focus

## Global search

### Problem summary

A collapsible search bar allows users to access search functionality in small areas so they can perform a search at any point in the experience.

The most common use case for the collapsible search is the **Global Search** pattern, which allows users to launch a search from any point in the experience by triggering the search icon located in the product header.

### User needs

- A user needs to quickly and easily discover information on-demand, at a product-wide level.
- A user needs to perform a high-level search when they don't know where to find the content they're looking for.

### Uniqueness

Context sensitive, personalization

### Constraints & challenges

- Search needs to be accessible throughout a user experience
- Search needs to be responsive
- Text should inform users what types of results to expect

### Behavior & transition

- The collapsed state of this search is the search icon-only button, which triggers the expanded state
- The expanded state is the basic search bar component
- The transition from collapsed to expanded state and vice versa is animated
- When the user navigates away from the interface containing the search, the search bar is collapsed and the search input is cleared
- When the search input is empty and the user interacts with a new element, the search bar is collapsed

## Targeted search

### Problem summary

Targeted search allows users to quickly and easily search within a specific category so they can find more relevant content.

As opposed to global searches, which are performed at a high level in order to locate unknown content, the targeted search should be used for scenarios when users understand what they need.

### User needs

- Users need to search for and find known items of interest in specific categories of data within healthcare domain.
- Users need to narrow my search to a specific category so that they can spend less time navigating irrelevant search results.

### Uniqueness

Context sensitive, personalization

### Constraints and challenges

- Target content store list needs to be contained to a small number of items

### Behavior and transition

- The search input and related target input should remain populated with the user's input after the query is submitted
- When the user navigates away from the interface containing the search, then the target input returns to the default selection and the input is cleared

## Faceted filtering

![filter](/images/filter.png)

### Guidelines

- Faceted filtering should be used when users are frequently querying large result sets
- In addition to allowing users to narrow down their results, faceted filtering should give users a better understanding of the data structure
- Filters should be grouped by logical categories with clear labels
- Filtering should always be paired with an ‘Apply’ button and a ‘Clear Filters’ button
