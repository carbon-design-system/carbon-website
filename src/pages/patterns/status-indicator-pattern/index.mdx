## Overview

An indicator highlights a page element and informs the user of something that
needs the user’s attention. Often, the indicator will denote that there has been
a change to a particular item. They are frequently used to signal validation
errors or notifications, changes, or updates. They can also be used on their
own. Indicators are visual cues intended to attract the user's attention to a
piece of content or UI element that is dynamic in nature.

In this pattern we explore:

- Choosing the best status indicators for your context
- The different status indicator variants
- What elements they are comprised of and how each element works to communicate

## Choosing for context

In the UI landscape, examples of status indicators are everywhere. However this
pattern will focus less on the components or patterns in which indicators tend
to appear (notifications, inline errors, dashboards, and so on) and more on the
urgency of the communication.

For ease of use, status indicators can be classified into levels of severity
such as high, medium, and low attention. See more information on choosing
between alias icons and outlined versus filled icons in the
[Status shapes](#status-shapes) section below.

#### Consolidated statuses

When multiple statuses are consolidated, use the highest-attention color to
represent the group. For example, if the statuses of underlying components are
green, yellow, and red, the consolidated indicator is red.

#### Cognitive load

Don't use status indicators when no user action is necessary and status
information is not important enough to highlight. Use plain text instead to
avoid the overuse of status indicators. While we won’t go as far a prescribing a
maximum number, more than 5 or 6 indicators begins to tax a user and makes it
difficult to focus.

### High attention

These indicators signal that user action is needed immediately—that is, there is
an irregularity in the system, something malfunctioned, or a user needs to
confirm a potentially destructive action. Some examples include alerts,
exceptions, confirmations, and errors.

<StatusIndicatorTable attention="high" />

### Medium attention

Use these indicators when no immediate user action is required or to provide
feedback to a user action. Some examples include acknowledgements and progress
indicators.

<StatusIndicatorTable attention="medium" />

### Low attention

Use these indicators when something is ready to view, for system feedback, or to
signify that something has changed since the last interaction. Some examples
include tooltip triggers that offer explanatory or added information, and
passive notifications.

<StatusIndicatorTable attention="low" />

## Ingredients

To communicate their message, indicators can take many forms—they're not
confined to iconography. There are four basic elements that comprise Carbon
status indicators. (Note: we won't get into animation and sound in this
pattern.) And for WCAG compliance, at least three of these elements must be
present. Let's look at these elements more closely before examining specific
status types.

- Symbols
- Shapes
- Colors
- Type

### Status icons

Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. Ideally,
they communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention
to important information. For example, using exclamation points for warnings,
checkmarks for success, and question marks for help or unknown.

To standardize the icons that are used most widely in IBM product, we’ve
included only the most universally recognized icons. Certain products may have
certain modifications or most robust sets.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of common status icons.](./images/status_indicator_1.png)

<Caption>Examples of some of the most common status symbols</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

### Status shapes

In this context, shapes refer to geometric figures like squares, circles,
rectangles, and so on, as they are instantly readable even at small sizes. These
shapes have strong visual associations that can be applied to help users succeed
in using their product flows. For instance, shapes with straight lines and 90
degree angles usually convey structure and order—like the grid. While shapes
with curves are friendlier and symbolize continuity and connection.

There can also be cultural associations connected with shapes. For example in
traffic and wayfinding, hexagons mean stop, and upside triangles means yield.
Using shapes incorrectly can disturb learned recognition patterns and confuse
users, possibly hurting their overall experience.

<Column colLg={8}>

![A circle, a square, a diamond, a triangle and a hexagon](./images/status_indicator_2.png)

<Caption>Example of the most common status shapes</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Outline versus filled shapes

We offer two options that can be flexible for usage based on your team's
preference. Keep in mind that filled icons are more visible and tend to carry
more weight, therefore they’re often used for high attention statuses. Outlined
icons are more delicate and not as readily scannable.

In addition, the more line work an icon has—and the more breaks in those
lines—the more difficult it is to use a filled icon. For this reason, some
product teams may occasionally mix in an outline icon with a filled icon. This
is okay but for the most part, designers should try to be consistent throughout
the product or application. At the very least, designers should avoid mixing
outlined and filled indicators on the same page.

#### Alias status icons

In several cases, we offer multiple shape options for one type of status
indicator. For example, ‘warning’ ‘help’ and ‘information’ status icons have
multiple variants to convey similar or exactly the same information. Often
times, users of certain products have grown accustomed to say, a hexagon instead
of a circle to convey a critical warning. Or a team perhaps wants to go the
extra mile and offer yet another differentiator for accessibility. Although
consistency is always the goal, there’s no need to avoid differentiation to
accommodate user preferences. Whichever style you choose however, avoid mixing
throughout the UI.

If an alias that your product frequently uses has been removed from the set and
you can make a case for the importance of including it here, please let us know.

### Status palette

The status palette includes all of the colors that can be used to reflect
status. Typically, red represents danger or error, orange represents a serious
warning, yellow represents a regular warning, green represents normal or
success, and blue represents passive notifications, usually involving additional
information and workflow progress. We’ve also included gray and purple to add
more depth to the system. Gray indicates drafts or jobs that haven’t been
started, and purple indicates outliers or undefined statuses.

<ColorPalette twoColumn type="status" />

#### Extended status palettes

This palette is only for added contrast accessibility when using yellows and
oranges. It’s not a part of the IBM brand palette and it’s also not included in
the v2 color release (that is, it’s not in ASE, Sketch kit palettes, and so on)
because it’s for very selective use in data visualizations and certain status
indicators. Do not use this palette in any other manner in your layouts.

<ColorPalette type="status-extended" shouldShowControls={false} />

## Variants

There are at least four possible ways to implement status indicators:

- Icon indicators
- Badge indicators (with and without numbers)
- Shape indicators
- Differential indicators

| Variant                           | Usage                                                                                                                                                                     | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Icon indicators                   | Used any time the layout offers ample space and the content requires maximum attention. They require an icon, a shape, a meaningful color and a descriptive inline label. | Icon indicators are widely used in [Notifications](/components/notification/usage), [Progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage), [Data tables](/components/data-table/usage), task lists and dashboard widgets. |
| Badge indicators (with number)    | Useful when a count of new or updated items is available, and it is important for the user to know the number of updates.                                                 | Most often used in notification panes in the header, and used in conjunction with avatars or icons.                                                                                                                             |
| Badge indicators (without number) | Useful when new or updated items are available and the number of notifications is unknown or irrelevant to the user. The dot badge is also more compact and discrete.     | Most often used in notification panes in the header, and used in conjunction with avatars or icons.                                                                                                                             |
| Shape indicators                  | Useful in smaller spaces or when users need to scan large amount of data.                                                                                                 | Most often used in lists, dashboards, data tables, data visualizations, and network diagrams.                                                                                                                                   |
| Differential indicators           | Useful when users are monitoring differentials in large lists of statistics and when anything other than type would be too obtrusive.                                     | Most often used in financial dashboards for highlighting deltas or other types of data visualizations.                                                                                                                          |

### Anatomy

Like a button, a status indicator’s text label is the most important element, as
it communicates progress. By default, Carbon uses sentence case for all button
labels.

Text labels, column labels (or a legend, when inline labels aren’t an option)
are strongly recommended.

## Formatting

### Icon indicators

Icon indicators require an icon, a shape, a meaningful color, and a descriptive
label. Easily recognizable icons can make very effective communication tools and
greatly improve scannability, especially with large amounts of content. Icon
indicators are widely used in notifications, progress indicators, data tables,
task lists and dashboard widgets.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Carbon notification component](./images/status_indicator_4.png)

<Caption>
  Notifications are the most prevalent example of this type of status indicator.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Type pairing and alignment

Icon indicators are sometimes referred to as ‘contextual’ status indicators as
well because they are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content.
As such they should be shown in close proximity to that element.

There are also cases, especially in data tables and lists, where the column
heading or row label may provide context that is additive to the inline label.
When very common ‘stop light’ associations are present, as in the following
example, it may not be necessary to explicitly label an icon as ‘warning,’ or
‘stable’ — as these interpretations are widely understood in product. However it
is good practice to clarify the status intention in the text label.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do left align icons and type in lists and data tables, regardless of whether you’re using the responsive grid or spacers." colLg={6}>

![Misaligned status indicator icons](images/status_indicator_6.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Badge indicators

Badge indicators let the user know that something is new or updated. A badge
status is displayed over a ghost icon button, usually in the header, to indicate
an active notification and is cleared after the user acknowledges the
notification. Depending on your use case, the icon button can open a new page or
launch a modal, pane, or flyout.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Example of badge indicators in a global header](./images/status_indicator_7.png)

<Caption>
  Badge statuses with numbers are usually used for global notifications.
</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Badge status with number

Numbers are used in conjunction with a badge status when a count of new or
updated items is available and it's important for the user to know the number of
updates.

Badge status numbers can only be used in conjunction with the large icon button
because with anything smaller, the icon gets covered. In very rare cases badge
number may exceed two digits.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Four icons with badges that included numbers ranging from one to three digits. The last badge has a plus.](./images/badge-status-with-number.jpg)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Badge status without number

A badge indicator with no number is used when a new notification is available
and the number of notifications is either unknown or irrelevant to the user. The
dot badge is less noticeable than the numbered badge, but still draws the user’s
attention to the icon button.

### Shape indicators

Shape indicators combine color shape and text to create a standard and
consistent way to indicate the status of a device, feature, or version. Icons
are not present. These shapes are also seen in certain diagrams and data
visualizations, for example network diagrams.

The shapes are only the most basic geometries, derived from the larger icon
containers, so they can be easily discerned at small sizes. Shape indicators are
not available in outline because they are so small. The only situations in which
you would use an outline is to ensure contrast accessibility for yellows or
oranges in the Carbon light themes.

The table below is a first pass at establishing a standard lexicon for symbol
indicators across IBM products.

#### Same shape, different color

The status shapes naturally allow more room for interpretation than the status
icons. Certain shapes can take on different colors for different circumstances.
However, NEVER use the same shape, in different colors, within the same
experience.

<StatusIndicatorTable attention="glyph" />

#### Type pairing and alignment

Shape indicators are also ‘contextual’ status indicators. Like the status icons
above, assets have been created for the shape indicators that take into account
optical alignment. Do not attempt to create these shapes yourself. Use the
approved shape indicator provided for you in the icon library.

As with the icons, choose the appropriate canvas size depending on the size of
the status label with which it is paired. 16px symbols are optimized to feel
balanced when paired with both 12px and 14px IBM Plex. Since shape indicators
are most often reserved for small usage scenarios in product, we would advise
you to use full status indicators with 16px IBM Plex.

<Column colLg={8}>

<Caption>Example of the status label directly next to the shape</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

#### Legends

Because shape indicators don’t have the added recognition of an icon, it’s even
more important that they are paired with a status label. Alternately, the
designer can provide the user with a legend if a status label isn’t an option.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Differential indicators

Differential indicators often help users understand the movement or changes in
information. They are especially useful when users are monitoring differences in
large lists of statistics and anything other than type would be too obtrusive.
Examples include the common convention of color-coding stock symbols in an
investment account if their price has changed substantially. Designers also rely
on them to highlight deltas in data visualizations.

Although typographic indicators can be used without an icon as long as a minus
or a plus sign is used, they are most often paired with arrow or caret icons in
our system.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Caret and arrow icons](./images/status_indicator_16.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Color

Differential indicators are either displaying a positive or a negative value.
Color is optional in these situations as long as the value has either a ‘+’ or
‘-’ in front of it, a chevron icon, or an arrow icon. Unless the data involves
temperature, positive values are represented by the green spectrum and negative
values are represented by the red spectrum.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Examples of differential indicators](./images/status_indicator_15.png)

<Caption>Differential indicators are most often seen in dashboards.</Caption>

</Column>
</Row>

## Accessibility

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities, it provides better
user experiences for everyone. The most common form of color blindness is
red/green color blindness. The inability for some users to distinguish between
red and green means that products cannot simply rely on color to show status. As
a result, the status system relies on three key elements; color, shape, and
symbol.

For example, the critical icon is not just “red”, it is the sum of the following
elements.

Color = Red <br /> Shape = Circle <br /> Symbol = \ <br /> Text = Critical

<br />

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont type="do" caption="Do include at least three out of four indicators of status to meet accessibility requirements." colLg={6}>

![Example of accessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_17.png)

  </DoDont>
  <DoDont type="dont" colLg={6} caption="Avoid designs with less than three indicators of status; using solely color and symbols is inaccessible.">

![Example of inaccessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_18.png)

  </DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Status notifications

#### Don’t use notifications that dismiss on a timer for critical or emergency messages.

Some users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with messages
and timed toasts may not provide sufficient time. WCAG 2.1 success criterion
2.2.4 (AAA)

#### Users should be able to manage or limit non-critical notifications.

This gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions
they receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive
limitations. WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.3 (AAA)
