## Overview

A text toolbar is a set of buttons and menus that is grouped horizontally. These
controls primarily allow text editing functionality. Formatting actions and
style changes can be applied to the editable text within the text area below the
text toolbar. Attaching files, embedding links, and searching keywords are
additional functions a toolbar can have.

A text toolbar can be customized by adding or removing icon buttons based on
specific user needs. This pattern illustrates the following options:

<Row>
<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>

- Redo
- Undo
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste
- Typeface
- Type size
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline

</Column>
<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>

- Text color
- Alignment
- Bulleted list
- Checked list
- Numbered list
- Indent more
- Indent less
- Attachment
- Link
- Search

</Column>
</Row>

## Anatomy

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Actions:** Use “Undo” and “Redo” to undo or revert the last change made.
   Use “Cut”, “Copy”, and “Paste” to move pieces of text to another place within
   the text area, to copy text to the clipboard, or to paste copied text from
   the clipboard to a different place within the text area.
2. **Formatting:** Change the typeface, size, style, and color of text.
3. **Paragraph:** Select different alignments and indents for paragraph text and
   indicate bulleted, checked, or numbered lists.
4. **Attachment:** Attach files or embed links in strings of text.
5. **Search:** Search keywords within existing paragraphs of text.
6. **Text area:** Designated area to type editable text.

## When to use

The text toolbar provides an efficient way for users to perform several tasks:

- Create, edit and save simple text files quickly.
- Edit text with common actions like cut, copy and paste and formatting text
  styles.
- Perform basic text search functionality.
- Attach files or embed links within text.

## Behaviors

### States

The text toolbar includes a series of basic actions that adopt the
[icon button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage) style.
The action buttons typically have five different states—enabled, hover, focus,
active, and disabled.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Text toolbar button states.](/images/text-toolbar-button-states.png)

</Column>
</Row>

The typeface and type size menus adopt the
[dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/#dropdown)
style. The user can easily choose any typeface and type size to customize their
text.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Text toolbar dropdowns.](/images/text-toolbar-dropdowns.png)

</Column>
</Row>

The text color and paragraph alignment controls open a menu that displays
different options to choose from.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Text toolbar menus.](/images/text-toolbar-menus.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Attach files

The user can upload and attach a file from their computer.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Hover on "Attachment" button.](/images/text-toolbar-attachment-hover.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Once a file has been chosen, the file will load in the bottom left of the text
area. A file can be removed by clicking the close `x` icon.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Attaching files to the text area.](/images/text-toolbar-attachment.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Embed links

Links can be embedded within strings of text. To embed a link, click on the link
button to open the text field.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Embedding text links.](/images/text-toolbar-link-open.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Enter the html link in the text field and then click the link button to embed
the link. To exit the text field, click the close `x` icon or anywhere outside
of the field. To reopen the link text field to edit or delete, highlight the
inline link text with the cursor.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Embedding text links.](/images/text-toolbar-link-embed.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Search

Keywords can be searched within the text area.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Searching text keywords.](/images/text-toolbar-search-flow.png)

</Column>
</Row>

Matching search results are highlighted in the text area. The number of results
found is displayed within a tag in the search bar. The user can clear the search
by clicking the close `x` icon inside of the tag. To exit the search, click the
close `x` icon in the search field or click anywhere outside of the search bar.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Search keyword matches within the text area.](/images/text-toolbar-search-highlight.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Responsiveness

The text toolbar flexes in size to adapt to different breakpoints—max, xlg, lg,
md, and sm.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Responsive versions of a text toolbar.](/images/text-toolbar-responsive.png)

</Column>
</Row>

| Breakpoint | Use case                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| max, xlg   | Displays all controls and functionality in one row with the option to make the search field longer or shorter. |
| lg         | The search field is truncated into a button or use an overflow menu to display collapsed controls.             |
| md         | Compresses the full text toolbar into two rows.                                                                |
| sm         | A more compact version of "md" with collapsed controls in an overflow menu.                                    |

### Overflow

The overflow menu is used to display a list of multiple controls when horizontal
space for the toolbar becomes restricted or when it is adapting to breakpoints.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Overflow menu options.](/images/text-toolbar-overflow-menu.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Saving

Text toolbars can be used to save or send text files. Text files can also be
saved as drafts to be edited again at a later date. Drafts can be saved with an
explicit "Save draft" button or it can autosave depending on the use case.

<Row>
<Column colLg={12}>

![Saving a text file.](/images/text-toolbar-save.png)

</Column>
</Row>

## Accessibility

### Tooltips

Buttons that complete an action upon click receive tooltips on hover and focus.

<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>

![Tooltips on hover for buttons in a text toolbar.](/images/text-toolbar-tooltip.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Keyboard

`Tab` and `Shift + Tab` move focus in and out of the toolbar.

#### When focus moves into a toolbar:

- If focus is moving into the toolbar for the first time, focus is set on the
  first control that is not disabled.
- If the toolbar has previously contained focus, focus is optionally set on the
  control that last had focus. Otherwise, it is set on the first control that is
  not disabled.

#### Horizontal toolbars:

- The `Left Arrow` moves focus to the previous control.
- The `Right Arrow` moves focus to the next control.

#### Menus:

- The `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` navigate to different options within a menu.
- Open and close a menu by pressing `Enter`.

### Screen readers

When a set of controls is visually presented as a group, the `toolbar` role can
be used to communicate the presence and purpose of the grouping to screen reader
users. Grouping controls into toolbars can also be an effective way of reducing
the number of tab stops in the keyboard interface.
