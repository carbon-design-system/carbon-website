## Audience

This tutorial is intended for people with all amounts of web development
experience. If you want to jump straight to code, you may want to skip this
tutorial and go to the
[developers getting started](/get-started/develop/angular) page.

## Prerequisites

### Angular

This is a web development tutorial that uses the Carbon Angular components. If
you're just getting started with Angular and enjoy learning-by-doing, check out
the official Angular [guide](https://angular.io/docs).

### ES6/ES2015

Angular apps often use the latest and greatest from JavaScript (ES6/ES2015).
You'll want to be up to speed on the most commonly used features of the
language.
[Let's Learn ES6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57atfCFqj2h5fpdZD-doGEIs0NZxeJTX)
covers those features in depth.

### GitHub

We'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make
sure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their
[getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a
great way to learn GitHub.

### npm

This tutorial uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management. Make
sure that you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) prior to
starting the tutorial so you can follow along step-by-step.

## Outline

Each step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web
applications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can pick up
any step and take it from there.

1. [**Installing Carbon**](/tutorial/angular/step-1)
   - Create a web app with the UI shell component.
1. [**Building pages**](/tutorial/angular/step-2)
   - Build out pages with the grid and various components.
1. [**Using APIs**](/tutorial/angular/step-3)
   - Populate the data table with an external data source.
1. [**Creating components**](/tutorial/angular/step-4)
   - Extend Carbon by creating your own components.
1. [**Deploying to IBM Cloud**](/tutorial/angular/step-5)
   - Build and host your app in a production environment.
