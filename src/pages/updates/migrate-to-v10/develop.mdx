## Repo architecture

[Carbon-themes](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-themes) has been deprecated in v10, as the [carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon) repository now contains the themes package [@carbon/themes](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/themes).

[Carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons) has not yet been deprecated in favor of [@carbon/icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/icons). That is expected to happen in an upcoming dot release.

## Carbon components

Carbon components have been completely re-skinned for the new IBM Design Language. The redesign was conducted with maximum backwards-compatibility in mind. Users of v9 should be able to upgrade to v10 automatically with minimal breakage.

#### carbon-components

Detailed technical migration docs for Carbon vanilla components are available in the [carbon-components repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/components/docs/migration/migrate-to-10.x.md). Here you will find links to component-level migration information, as well as a list of those components that have been removed or are under development.

There is also a dedicated [Sass migration guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/components/src/globals/scss/migrate-to-10.x.md) that covers changes to global styling.

#### carbon-components-react

React-specific technical migration docs are available [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react/docs/migration).

## Carbon Elements

All technical migration docs for Carbon Elements are available in the [carbon repo's docs folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/docs/migration).

#### Icons

Carbon icons underwent a major update for v10. The @carbon/icons package can be now be found in the [Carbon Elements repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/icons). This package will be publically available in an upcoming release, for now please continue to use the [`carbon-icons`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons) repo.

See the [icons migration table](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/docs/migration/10.x-icons.md) to view .

The [Carbon Icons Demo](https://carbon-elements.netlify.com/icons/examples/preview/) contains a master table for all Carbon icons, including name, size, preview, download links, quick links for filing issues, module name, and relative path.

#### Color

The color token architecture for v10 is based on the v9 architecture, with some minor updates for the new design language. Carbon v9 users will see automatic, non-breaking color updates when they upgrade to v10.

#### Type

The type token architecture has been completely redesigned for better clarity and flexibility in v10, moving from a basic type scale model to a more robust token-based architecture.

Spacing values will see no change from Carbon v9, though the token names have changed.

#### Motion

Motion standards have been revised to meet the new IBM Design Language standards. Motion updates should be coordinated with your product's design team if possible.
