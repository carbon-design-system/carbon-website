## Introduction

The Carbon team is always exploring different ways to serve our users. We work
in the open, and this page is here to give you early previews of what we're
working on.

That could mean making an unfinished Sketch kit available for download, linking
to GitHub issues for proposed components and patterns, or sharing graphics files
of concepts for how we might present content.

Not everything here may make it into production, while other pieces might become
central pieces of the design system. It's an early opportunity for you to
provide feedback and have a say in Carbon's direction.
