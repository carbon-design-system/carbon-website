### Weekly design playback

#### Every Friday, 2pm Central, One hour

You’ve got some work in progress and you’re ready to open it up and share it
with a broader audience for honest (and caring!) feedback. Verify that you’re
working with the grid correctly, that you’re using the right components, that
you’re using the correct language. Sign up to share, or come along to see other
work in progress and learn that way.

### Carbon Insiders

#### First Fridays, 9:30am Central, One hour

An open forum for developers in product teams to come together with Carbon
developers and designers. Talk through questions, challenges, and share ideas
for building products with Carbon. All topics welcome.

### Design pin-ups

#### Contact us to schedule, Two + hours

Put your screens up in MURAL and step through the flow and page designs with the
Carbon designers. Great for assessing the overall flow, page layouts, the best
choices and use of components, content—everything from the big picture to the
smallest detail!
