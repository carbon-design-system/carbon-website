You’ve got some work in progress and you’re ready to open it up and share it
with a broader audience for honest (and caring!) feedback. Verify that you’re
working with the grid correctly, that you’re using the right components, that
you’re using the correct language. Sign up to share, or come along to see other
work in progress and learn that way.

Put your screens up in MURAL and step through the flow and page designs with the
Carbon designers. Great for assessing the overall flow, page layouts, the best
choices and use of components, content—everything from the big picture to the
smallest detail! Usually two or more hours.
