You’ve got some work in progress and you’re ready to open it up and share it
with a broader audience for honest (and caring!) feedback. Verify that you’re
working with the grid correctly, that you’re using the right components, that
you’re using the correct language. Sign up to share, or come along to see other
work in progress and learn that way.
