<h2>
  Weekly design playback
  <span>Fridays, 12pm–1pm Central</span>
</h2>

_For IBMers only:_ You’ve got some work in progress and you’re ready to open it
up and share it with a broader audience for honest (and caring!) feedback.
Verify that you’re working with the grid correctly, that you’re using the right
components, that you’re using the correct language. Sign up to share, or come
along to see other work in progress and learn that way.

<h2>
  Data visualization weekly playback

_For IBMers only:_ Are you designing a product with data visualization needs?
These weekly playback calls are a chance for us to have dataviz stakeholders
present, discuss design explorations, gather feedback and business unit
requirements, and determine next steps on requested components or functionality.

_For IBMers only:_ A monthly meeting for teams building on top of Carbon to
discuss best practices, identify areas of reuse, and bring up things the Carbon
team can do to make their jobs easier. This group helps out with Carbon's
release cycles to detect breaking changes.

_For IBMers only:_ Put your screens up in MURAL and step through the flow and
page designs with the Carbon designers. Great for assessing the overall flow,
page layouts, the best choices and use of components, content—everything from
the big picture to the smallest detail! Usually two or more hours.
