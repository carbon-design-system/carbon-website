This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do. Some things on the
roadmap might change — the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help
product teams prepare and plan their own work.

## Recently shipped

We recently:

- ensured React
  [default props are initialized with serially-stable values](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/10777).
- re-wrote our
  [contribution guidance](https://carbondesignsystem.com/contributing/get-started/)
  to better center around the designer and developer experience.
- migrated our
  [React tutorial](https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview/)
  from Create React App to NextJs. (thanks to
  [Jeremy Caine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremycaine/))
- added a
  [background option](https://deploy-preview-14726--v11-carbon-react.netlify.app/?path=/story/components-structuredlist--with-background-layer)
  to `StructuredList`.
- reduced the time it takes for teams
  [to get to v11](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/13696).
- created the
  [UIShell template](<https://www.figma.com/file/YAnB1jKx0yCUL29j6uSLpg/(v11)-All-themes---Carbon-Design-System?type=design&node-id=1756-1439&mode=design&t=URumHdfZA3venBCS-0>)
  in Figma.
- Deprecated our white, g10, g90, and g100 Figma theme libraries in favor of a
  singular library for
  [v10](<https://www.figma.com/file/Vzz8k68Pqk5HfaTdQOQrGu/(v10)-All-themes---Carbon-Design-System?type=design&mode=design&t=EKRzSDn1uk96FJZs-0>)
  and
  [v11](<https://www.figma.com/file/YAnB1jKx0yCUL29j6uSLpg/(v11)-All-themes---Carbon-Design-System?type=design&node-id=58-2763&mode=design&t=oaAmSxPVT5FUoN3F-0>),
  respectively.

## Working on now

We're currently investing in work-streams centered around accessibility, new IBM
acquisitions adopting Carbon, component enhancements, and of course... AI.

We're working on:

- adding a
  [component accessibility status](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/13745)
  to better inform _you_ when consuming our components. ♿
- updating our
  [accessibility tabs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/13521)
  across all of our components to give you more clear guidance when using our
  components.
- creating
  [documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/14009)
  for newly acquirely IBM product teams to more easily size and estimate what it
  will take to adopt Carbon into their offering.
- migrating our
  [React examples](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/13637)
  off of Create-React-App.
- bringing in
  [AI enhancements](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/15097)
  to all the core components.
- bringing in
  [new components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/3563),
  including `ComboButton`, `MenuButton`, and `OverflowMenu`, built on our `Menu`
  primitive.

## Coming up next

In a not-to-distant future we plan to:

- bring
  "[select all](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/4593)"
  functionality to our `Multi-select` component.
- add the ability to
  [enter a unique](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/6102)
  value into `ComboBox`.
- Align our
  [Storybook experience to reflect our website experience](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/12947)
  more accurately.
- Enter phase 2 of our AI strategy.

## Future plans

The future certainly is less clear, but we intend to:

- Add
  [Status Indictors](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/13429)
  to the core components.
- Pin all
  [Github Actions](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/14052)
  to a full length commit SHA.
