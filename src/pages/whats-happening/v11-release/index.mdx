## Overview

Carbon v11 focuses on quality of life updates for designers and developers
including token and prop renaming for ease of use, component API updates for a

layout building in line with the design language.

With no changes to the IBM Design Language, v11 will not require any
brand-driven product redesigns.

  language.
- Inline theming for light/dark modes.
- Token renaming for better understanding and ease of use.
- Size props introduced for icons to reduce icon package size.
- Reduced compile times with new Sass modules.

### What’s not changing

- No changes to the IBM Design Language.
- No need to redesign your UI.
- Tokens that are changing will continue to work in v11.
- Assets that are deprecated in v10 will remain in v11 and will be removed in
  v12.
